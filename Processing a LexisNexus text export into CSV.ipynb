      "flavoring using electronic devices like e-cigarettes or hand-held canisters that\n",
      "act like miniature hookahs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, the dangers of vaping are not fully understood, but the U.S. Food and\n",
      "Drug Administration warns that inhaling does introduce toxins like formaldehyde\n",
      "into the body, just as smoking does. The vapor also includes nicotine, the\n",
      "addictive ingredient  in cigarettes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaping supporters say the ability to control the amount of nicotine in vapor has\n",
      "been a selling point: Smokers can switch to vaping and gradually dial down the\n",
      "nicotine they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the presence of nicotine in exhaled vapor still exposes the public to health\n",
      "risks; to what degree is not clear.\n",

      "To discourage that trend, the health district is following an example set by\n",
      "other Washington counties that have already applied SIPP to vaping. Snohomish\n",
      "and Pierce counties allow vaping where the products are sold but limit consumer\n",
      "sampling: There are hundreds of different vaping devices and flavors.\n",

      "The district notes consumers are not allowed to sample tobacco or marijuana in\n",

      "years. To use, you just set it on fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some accommodation for limited use on store premises might be reasonable as long\n",
