Regulation for sake of health, safety

KUALA LUMPUR: MANUFACTURERS and sellers of vaping devices will be subjected to a
major shift in the way they market their gadgets and accompanying odds and ends.

As the authorities work together to address concerns related to the
rapidly-growing trend of vaping, those in the business are looking at being
subjected to a systematic mechanism that will serve to safeguard public safety
and health.

The Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry told the New Sunday
Times that in looking at regulating the industry, those in the business could
soon be allowed to only sell devices that were certified and approved by the
Department of Standards Malaysia (Sirim-approved).

Its secretary-general, Datuk Seri Alias Ahmad, said there was a need to regulate
the prices of vaping devices and e-liquids to protect consumers.

He said the ministry was working with the Health Ministry and would engage
stakeholders to ensure that all areas in the regulation of vaping were covered.

""Give us enough time to study the important aspects (concerning vaping),
including legal and health issues, as well as the impact that the trend has on
society (before decisions are finalised).""

The Health Ministry is already looking at tangible measures to be put in place
to regulate vaping.

Vapers in the country, whose numbers rank second only to the United States, may
have to fork out more, as the ministry is looking at extending the sin tax
imposed on cigarettes to vaping devices and e-liquids.

The proposed change in the industry is on top of other new regulatory measures
likely to be introduced, including import control.

The spirit behind this, said the ministry, was to discourage the habit.

Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam told the New Straits Times on
Friday that he was looking at imposing a minimum age requirement for those
buying and using vaping devices.

Another measure would be to make it compulsory for the ingredients in e-liquids
to be listed on the labels.

As the rules to govern vaping continue to snowball, he said, the ministry would
likely limit the places where vaping was allowed, similar to the way it had
prohibited cigarette smoking in areas gazetted as non-smoking zones.

He said this was important to protect non-vapers from the potential health risks
that vaping could pose.

He said the ministry was worried by the speed with which the vaping trend had
picked up in the country.

""The estimate is that there are one million vapers in the country.

""Vaping is now unregulated, (and) we can't allow it. We are coming up with
regulations that will control vaping-related activities as soon as possible.

""We've been studying them (regulations) for some time now, and we will start
soon. We've got enough power to act.""

Dr Subramaniam said he hoped vapers would consider the fact that vaping had not
been scientifically proven safe, and would cease from the habit until the
ministry and experts concluded research on the health risks not only to those
who vaped, but also ""passive vapers"".

He said it was important to realise that vaping was a relatively new trend, and
although there was insufficient evidence to conclusively prove the dangers of
vaping devices, experts had warned that the health risks from vaping might
manifest over the long term.

He said while there might be different schools of thought on the matter,
including one that suggested vaping was a safer option to smoking cigarettes
because of the lower nicotine content, it could take up to 20 years to gather
evidence.

""There's no hard evidence at present (to suggest vaping is safe). We have little
information on it.

""Why pick up something that may be bad?

""My advice to all smokers, whether cigarettes, shisha, cigars, pipes or
e-cigarettes - choose to stay healthy.""

Rural and Regional Development Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, who
opposes the ban on vaping, said he concurred with the need for regulation, and
to ensure that the use of nicotine and other chemicals in e-liquids was safe.

He said the government should also focus on reducing the number of smokers.

CLOUDY FUTURE FOR VAPING Health district pushes to restrict e-cigarette use in
public places

At Smokin' Legal Vaperz, Alex Overman can try out more than 260 juice flavors
for his electronic vaping device.

His current favorite is lime cheesecake.

""Instead of stinking like cigarettes, I smell like limes,"" said Overman, a
former smoker and a customer at the North Division Street store, who credits
e-cigarettes for helping him kick a three-pack-a-day habit.

Managers at the Smokin' Legal Vaperz say most of their clients are former
smokers who've turned to vaping as a healthier alternative to cigarettes.

But the store's ability to demonstrate the use of vaping devices - and allow
customers to test flavors - could be prohibited under new Spokane Regional
Health District regulations.

The proposal is part of the health district's effort to extend prohibitions on
smoking in public places to vaping devices. Anywhere that smoking is forbidden,
vaping would be forbidden, too, said Paige McGowan, the health district's
coordinator of tobacco, electronic cigarettes and marijuana prevention.

That means no vaping in indoor public spaces or at worksites, even for vaping
retailers.

About a half-dozen Washington counties - including King and Snohomish - have
adopted similar rules, and others are considering them. McGowan said counties
are acting on concerns about the health effects of nicotine delivery in an
aerosol form, including vaping's allure to teenagers. Federal studies show that
teens who have never smoked or used other tobacco products are taking up vaping.

""We don't know the long-term impacts of breathing in this type of aerosol,""
McGowan said. ""We don't know what bystanders are being exposed to.""

But the mosaic of regulations being adopted by counties concerns the nonprofit
Washington Vape Association, which would prefer to see the state create uniform
rules.

""We think it's far more sensible, productive and logical if there is statewide
legislation,"" said Joe Baba, the association's chairman and co-founder. ""We're
urging caution and patience to the counties, to see what the 2016 legislative
session produces.""

Last year, the Washington Legislature considered licensing requirements for
vaping retailers, but the proposal didn't become law.

Baba said most association members support restrictions on vaping in indoor
public places, with exceptions for vaping stores open to individuals 18 and
older. Currently, tobacco products can only be sold to people 18 and older, but
state regulations don't prohibit younger teens from visiting vaping stores.

""We believe in educating (adult) customers that come into the store on how to
use vaping devices properly ... and offering a variety of flavor choices so they
can find the one that will help them quit smoking,"" said Baba, who is the
co-owner of Vaporland stores in Snohomish County and of Twilight Vapor, a
marketing company.

McGowan, of the Spokane Regional Health District, said she hasn't seen any
pending state legislation that restricts vaping in public places, but if the
state adopts rules, they would take precedence over the county's actions.

At Smokin' Legal Vaperz's three stores in Spokane County, access is already
restricted to people 18 and older, said Luke Patterson, an employee.

A few of the customers are what Patterson calls ""hobbyists,"" who enjoy the art
of blowing vapor. But most are former smokers who are gradually reducing the
nicotine content in the liquid solution used in vaping devices, he said.

""We ask what brand they're smoking, and how many cigarettes per day,"" he said.
""That allows us to match their nicotine levels. In most cases, we're reluctant
to sell to people who are just starting.""

But vaping's effectiveness for smoking cessation remains a matter of scientific
inquiry and debate. And the jury is still out on the long-term health impacts of
vaping.

McGowan cites U.S. Food and Drug Administration studies that found heavy metals,
formaldehyde and other cancer-causing agents in the inhaled vapor. An article on
the Seattle-King County Public Health Department's website also said  exhaled
vapor exposes bystanders to nicotine, which is highly addictive.

Patterson cites competing studies, which said the research results can be skewed
by use of a mechanical inhaler, which amplifies what people would breathe into
their lungs.

Overman, 23, the Smokin' Legal Vaperz customer, said he's convinced  vaping
helped him quit smoking, a habit he started at 16.

""After the first month, I could take a walk without wheezing,"" he said. ""I don't
get colds anymore, and I can actually go to the gym and work out.""

During the two years he's been vaping, Overman said he's reduced the amount of
nicotine in his e-cigarettes from 24 milligrams to 3 milligrams per milliliter.
His eventual goal is to be nicotine-free.

When he's visiting family in Spokane, Overman frequently visits the store on
North Division. He enjoys hanging out, testing products and talking to the
staff. In Everett, where he  lives, Snohomish County's health department
recently put restrictions on vaping stores.

Only one employee can demonstrate vaping products at a time. The stores must
have ventilation equipment, and only five seats are allowed at the testing
counter. Health officials don't want stores to create a ""vaping lounge""
atmosphere, where customers are encouraged to linger, said Heather Thomas, a
spokeswoman for the Snohomish County health department.

The rules, adopted in early December, have changed the experience of being in a
vaping store in Snohomish County, Overman said.

""They can't have couches or TVs,"" he said of retailers. And after about 30
minutes, customers are encouraged to move on, Overman said.

VAPING TREND WORTH ATTENTION

SECTION: A; Pg. 011

LENGTH: 520 words","


EDITORIAL

Vaping, like smoking, should be regulated and taxed.

A proposed resolution by the Spokane Regional Health District would bring vaping
under the Smoking in Public Places law that has controlled tobacco use in
Washington for a decade. The SIPP law has significantly curtailed tobacco use,
and with it the incidence of diseases such as asthma.

Smoking among high school sophomores has dropped by almost one-half in
Washington, although less in Spokane County.

But many who have taken messages about tobacco's dangers to heart have turned to
vaping as an alternative. Vaping heats - rather than  burns - synthetic
flavoring using electronic devices like e-cigarettes or hand-held canisters that
act like miniature hookahs.

So far, the dangers of vaping are not fully understood, but the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration warns that inhaling does introduce toxins like formaldehyde
into the body, just as smoking does. The vapor also includes nicotine, the
addictive ingredient  in cigarettes.

Vaping supporters say the ability to control the amount of nicotine in vapor has
been a selling point: Smokers can switch to vaping and gradually dial down the
nicotine they need.

But the presence of nicotine in exhaled vapor still exposes the public to health
risks; to what degree is not clear.

Health district officials fear vaping could ""renormalize"" tobacco use and its
social acceptance after years of alerting the public to its dangers. In 2014, 23
percent of high school seniors said they had vaped within the last 30 days.

To discourage that trend, the health district is following an example set by
other Washington counties that have already applied SIPP to vaping. Snohomish
and Pierce counties allow vaping where the products are sold but limit consumer
sampling: There are hundreds of different vaping devices and flavors.

King County does not allow vaping  indoors - the same ban SIPP imposes on
tobacco products. That is the standard proposed in Spokane.

The district notes consumers are not allowed to sample tobacco or marijuana in
the store, which is true. But the use of both has been around for hundreds of
years. To use, you just set it on fire.

Some accommodation for limited use on store premises might be reasonable as long
as anyone younger  than 18 is excluded, ventilation isolates the store from
adjacent businesses and testing like that done on marijuana products is
required.

Meanwhile, the industry plans to reintroduce legislation next year that will
bring uniformity to vaping regulation statewide.

If that uniformity is advisable, or even it it isn't, a deal should include the
application of some additional tax to vaping products now subject only to sales
tax. Legislation that stalled this year would have imposed a tax of 95 percent,
which nevertheless would have kept the cost of vaping below that of tobacco,
according to its sponsor.

Taxation that high would snuff out many small businesses selling a product
almost certainly less dangerous than the alternative: smoking.

Vaping has its place. We should know where, and at what cost, by spring.

Research on vaping starts to clear smoke on possible health effects

Chelsey Bowles said she doesn't stink anymore.

""Not smelling like an ashtray is nice, definitely,"" the Hanover resident said.

Bowles said she no longer coughs in the mornings, her taste buds are back, she
can smell again, and walking up stairs is no big deal.

That's the difference, she said, between smoking cigarettes and vaping.

At SS Vape in Manchester Township, 19-year-old Bowles said she was smoking about
a pack a day before completely making the switch in December.

Bowles is part of the exploding popularity of vaping, or using a smokeless
""cigarette"" that, when inhaled, electronically delivers flavored liquid with
varying levels of nicotine. She started with 24 mg, and now she's down to 3 mg
per bottle of vaping liquid.

Success: Officials are pushing for more regulation as the debate rages on over
vaping's possible health effects and role as a smoking-cessation tool. Gov. Tom
Wolf has proposed a 40 percent wholesale tax on vaping devices.

""I have an issue with that, because he's trying to lump us in with tobacco,""
Bobby Allen said. ""This isn't tobacco.""

A smoker since he was 11 years old, Allen said that in September he went from
more than two packs a day to nonsmoker in just two days of vaping.

Allen, 38, of York City said he uses only 0 to 3 mg of nicotine but ""jumped into
the hobby aspect""   he makes his own coils, allowing him to get a bigger hit
with more flavor and a bigger cloud.

Drew Klinedinst, 30, of York City said he was a smoker for 15 years before
vaping for the first time last October.

""I did this for three days, and I couldn't stand cigarettes,"" he said, noting
that he uses 3 to 6 mg of nicotine.

Education: Marie Drawbaugh, a tobacco cessation specialist for York Hospital,
said she doesn't recommend vaping as a method of quitting cigarettes; she
suggests evidence-based methods for her clients.

If smokers do want to quit with vaping, they should ""do their homework and
understand what they're getting,"" she said.

""We don't even know what's gonna happen in the long term,"" Drawbaugh said of the
possible health effects. ""Twenty years from now, we'll see.""

Drawbaugh said maybe 20 percent of her clientele has tried vaping, but younger
clients are more likely to make the switch   older smokers say it doesn't feel
the same.

""They'll try them, but many of them say, 'No, that's not what I want,'"" she
said.

If a smoker wants to switch, it's important to avoid using combustible
cigarettes and a vaping device simultaneously, Drawbaugh said.

""My concern is the people who go back and forth all day long, because who knows
how much nicotine they're getting then?"" she said.

For Karen Rizzo, president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society, successful
bridging from smoking to vaping is a welcomed, positive outcome.

""This concept is an option to talk about with patients that are trying, are
motivated to quit,"" she said. ""That's where the usefulness of this product, in
my mind, is.""

Unregulated: Nicotine is ""a very serious addiction that's not given credit for
how binding it is,"" said Pam Miller, a tobacco cessation specialist for Memorial
Hospital.

And with thousands of liquids and more than 400 unregulated brands of vaping
devices on the market, ""we don't know exactly how much people are getting,"" she
said.

Miller said she focuses on intent when her clients take up vaping: If they want
to try it for harm reduction, ""I think there could be value in that person
making a behavior change.""

She said she's seeing a lot of people making the switch with the thought that
vaping is smokeless and free of carbon monoxide   but transitions from vaping to
smoking nothing are rare.

""I have talked to people who have completely switched from combustible products
to e-cigarettes, but I haven't talked to people who've gone from there,"" Miller
said.

Using both products ""sort of perpetuates the habit and addiction,"" she said.
Some clients, for example, will go from smoking two packs a day to one   but
vape for the rest of the day, she said.

Miller said she's hoping the FDA puts some final regulations on vaping products
soon.

""The bottom line is, I want people to be able to make an informed decision for
themselves,"" Miller said.

Safer than cigs?: Vaping has a ""different risk profile"" than cigarettes, so it's
inappropriate to compare the products apples-to-apples, said Stanton Glantz, a
professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.

Because vaping doesn't burn anything, it exposes people to a lower risk profile
in terms of cancer-causing chemicals, he said.

But cigarettes are probably the most toxic consumer product ever developed, so
for vaping to be safer is meeting a ""low bar,"" said Glantz, director of UCSF's
Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.

The cloud emitted from vaping is not just water vapor, though   it's an aerosol
with nicotine, propylene glycol, flavors and fine particles that are one-50th
the size of a human hair, he said.

One way vaping enthusiasts can increase a hit is to raise the temperature of
coils in a device   and as they get hotter and hotter, Glantz said, more
formaldehyde is created.

""Some can produce more (formaldehyde) than conventional cigarettes,"" he said,
noting that some users hold competitions to see who can produce the biggest
cloud.

Health effects: As far as health impacts of vaping, ""we know a little bit,"" but
there's more science to be done, Glantz said during a March research briefing on
an RTI International study of the secondhand effects of vaping.

""We don't know anything about the long-term health impacts of e-cigarette use
because you have to wait a long time to find out,"" he said.

But it's well-established that exposure to ultra-fine particles has adverse
effects on blood vessels, as they prevent the vessels from getting large when
they need to, Glantz said.

The particles are small enough to go from the lungs to the bloodstream and
trigger an inflammatory process, he said.

When vapers exhale the aerosol, it's put out into an environment where
bystanders are exposed to those particles   ""a very strong justification for
integrating e-cigarettes into clean-air laws and policies,"" Glantz said.

Glantz said his guess is that, ""in the end, what we're gonna find is health
risks related to heart attacks and noncancer lung disease.""

City should butt out on e-cigarettes; Vaping is not a public health crisis; it's
not even much of a nuisance

BYLINE: Derek James, Calgary Herald

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A23

LENGTH: 714 words","


Calgary city council's proposed ban on vaping in public is giving me deja vu.

You may remember that, in 2013, councillors discussed banning shark fins, even
though they knew the bylaw was outside their jurisdiction. Despite this, some
councillors - motivated by feelings about the cruel treatment of sharks -
vigorously supported the ban.

Fortunately, no municipal government in Alberta can ban something merely because
it disapproves, or thinks it sets a bad example. So the ban's advocates
fabricated a narrative to support their cause. Sharks are apex predators, they
reasoned. Apex predators bio-accumulate mercury. Eating shark fins could lead to
mercury poisoning.

Ipso facto, a health crisis. Of course, this was a sham to distract Calgarians
from the fact that council had no authority to enact the ban. No councillors
were truly motivated by concern over mercury poisoning. To his credit, Coun.
Andre Chabot did not support the ban, because he saw it as an attempt by a
handful of his colleagues to codify their feelings into law.

Well, it's happening again. This time, council is about to enact a ban on vaping
. And just like the previous ban, some councillors (spurred on by Alberta Health
Services executives) have prioritized their disapproval of vaping over
restraining themselves within their proper authority. The adopted narrative this
time is that vaping is unsafe and a nuisance; it should therefore be banned in
all public spaces - including all private property to which the public has
access. It's prohibition all over again.

The narrative concocted to support this ban is a sham, too. Vaping is not a
public health crisis. Aside from a handful of deeply flawed studies that have
been discredited, the accumulated evidence is becoming clearer and clearer -
vaping is orders of magnitude less harmful than smoking is. And it's hardly more
of a nuisance than wearing an excessive amount of perfume.

Enter Chabot. He recently told the Calgary Herald that the proposed vaping ban
is ""ridiculous,"" since ""e-cigarettes have helped a lot of people that I know get
offof the use of tobacco."" He's right. It would be ridiculous (irrational, in
fact) to ban one of the most successful means of smoking cessation and treat it
like a combustible tobacco product.

The e-cigarettes used when vaping contain no tobacco and are not burned like
traditional cigarettes. Instead, the vapour they emit contains a small amount of
nicotine and some innocuous ingredients that are electronically vaporized and
inhaled. Whether inhaled directly or second hand, vaping is not associated with
any of the negative health effects of inhaling combusted tobacco products.
Importantly, statistics indicate that vaping helps smokers stop smoking.

Lacking their health-crisis narrative, what other support can these
prohibitionists muster? Vaping sets a bad example and will corrupt the youth. In
other words, won't someone think of the children? Kids could observe someone
vaping, take up the habit, and ultimately become smokers. It's a so-called
gateway hypothesis. Aside from the statistics undermining this gateway
hypothesis, you'd search long and hard through Alberta's Municipal Government
Act to find where it says that council can ban a practice merely because it
doesn't like the way it looks.

The real effect of this ban will be to curtail consumer choice and restrict
economic freedom. Currently, customers can sample vaping products in retail
stores, so that they purchase a product that will work for them. If vaping is
banned in all public spaces, customers will no longer be able to make use of
this important service.

Even if it were within council's jurisdiction, a vaping ban covering all public
spaces - including private businesses - would have the negative consequence of
making it more difficult for smokers to stop smoking. This is irrational.

City council should be considering reasonable accommodations to help smokers
stop smoking. And even though the city should be free to enact policies
restricting or banning vaping on its own property, it should butt out and let
people decide what to permit on their own.

Ministry to regulate e-cigarettes

BYLINE: Beatrice Nita Jay; Mujahid Mansor

SECTION: Pg. 3

LENGTH: 641 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: THE Health Ministry will not allow the unregulated use of
e-cigarettes, including vaping devices.

Despite the ministry's failure to get the cabinet's nod to ban vaping, a trend
already picked up by about one million users, it is aggressively working to put
in place stringent regulations to keep its use in check.

Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam told the New Straits Times that as
he and the healthcare community were deeply concerned about the rapid increase
in the number of people taking up vaping, he was looking into tangible action
that could, among others, prevent hazardous contents from making their way into
vaping liquids.

The ministry, he said, was also looking at applying the same set of rules
regulating the use of tobacco products to e-cigarettes.

This would mean that the use and sale of vaping devices and accompanying items
would be off limits to those under the age of 18.

Dr Subramaniam said the ministry was duty-bound to ensure the substances used in
the liquid were not hazardous to users.

The ministry had registered its concerns of possible long-term consequences of
inhaling vapours containing nicotine, formaldehyde and propylene glycol.

He also told the NST that in regulating vaping devices, including e-liquid that
contains nicotine, the existing Poisons Act 1952 (Revised 1989) would likely
come into play.

Under the act, nicotine is underlined under ""category C poison"", meaning
anything that contained the substance could only be sold and supplied as
dispensed medicine or an ingredient in dispensed medicine by licensed
practitioners.

Nicotine in tobacco is exempted from the act, as tobacco control is regulated
under the Food Act 1983.

As the ministry moves to regulate e-cigarettes in ways similar to how the sale
of tobacco products is governed, its promotion could also be restricted.

Under plans to regulate the use of e-cigarettes, the ministry is looking at
keeping certain public areas off limits to vapers.

The NST learned that the ministry would convene a meeting on Monday to detail
plans to regulate the use of vaping devices.

It is also understood that health experts with the ministry are studying
possible cancer-causing agents in e-liquids, including propylene glycol.

If heated for a prolonged period at five volts or higher, propylene glycol could
be converted into harmful substances such as formaldehyde.

The debate on the use of vaping devices gained momentum over the last few days
as the ministry made it clear it would ban vaping.

It had announced on Wednesday that it was looking at laws to ban e-cigarettes
and vaping devices.

Yesterday, many in the vaping community rejoiced when Rural and Regional
Development Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob posted on his Facebook
account that the cabinet had decided against banning e-cigarettes and vaping.

Dr Subramaniam, in a statement, said he had expressed ""his deep concern about
the steep increase in the number of people vaping in Malaysia and its possible
long-term consequences"".

The cabinet, he said, fully recognised the adverse health effects of cigarette
smoking and vaping, and the need for greater public health education on the
harmful effects of vaping, as well as the need to stringently regulate it.

The ministry, he said, would immediately work on the two matters.

He said safeguarding public health and regulating vaping, as well as the advent
of further evidence of the hazards of vaping, would be the deciding factors of
whether it would be banned in the future.

More Malaysians have, in recent years, picked up vaping, some as a new habit
while others, dependent on the device, to aid cessation of cigarette smoking.

The device, which atomises the e-liquid, is often doctored with additional
additives, such as flavourings and colourings.

Those containing nicotine come with various levels of concentration.

Parents' role in tackling teens' vaping habit

BYLINE: Audrey Vijaindren

LENGTH: 1833 words","


HIDDEN RISKS: There has been a long debate on the dangers of vaping, especially
among schoolchildren. Although the Education Ministry has set rules on the
matter, youngsters are still drawn to vaping, mainly because of peer influence.
Audrey Vijaindren speaks to industry experts, who believe the family unit plays
a big role in ending the problem

IT has been seen everywhere, from offices to schools. The trend of smoking
e-cigarettes, or vaping, is fast catching on.

How dangerous is it? And, should it be allowed in schools?

Vaping cases are treated as smoking cases in schools, and schoolchildren who
bring e-cigarettes or vape are subjected to the same disciplinary action meted
out to those who bring or smoke cigarettes, says Education Ministry
director-general Datuk Seri Dr Khair Mohamad Yusof.

""Private and international schools are subjected to smoking regulations.

""Vaping is considered smoking.

""It is considered trendy among schoolchildren and such devices are easily
available.

""The many flavours (of 'e-juice') attract schoolchildren to try vaping.

""Peer influence is one of the major factors in the rise in vaping cases among
schoolchildren.""

He says the ministry has always conducted campaigns against smoking,
encompassing cigarettes, cigars and pipes, as well as the latest trend of vaping
.

""Youngsters who are smokers are more likely to switch to vaping.

""Some of them say it is a means to quit smoking.

""However, the main reasons are peer influence and the perception that vaping is
trendy.""

Dr M. Swamenathan, senior consultant psychiatrist and head of the Psychiatry
Department at Melaka Manipal Medical College, believes that vaping is meant for
smokers who want to quit the habit.

""It is claimed that vaping gives the same pleasurable effects as smoking
nicotine, minus the health hazards of smoking conventional cigarettes.

""Nicotine is dependent-forming.

""Hence, there is room to believe that the nicotine intake when vaping can cause
dependence.""

He says those who start off with vaping may eventually go for ""stronger""
cigarettes.

""Local studies show that those who start smoking cigarettes before 15 are at a
higher risk of becoming heroin users in due course.""

He says adolescents, being in a vulnerable age group, need guidance and exposure
to positive parenting.

""Parents play a major part in eliminating the problem.

""Children from an unhappy family environment - where there is a discord, have
parents who smoke, are criminals or problem drinkers, or are divorced - are more
susceptible to pick up the habit.

""Children who are most at risk are those with a traumatic childhood experience,
such as having been abused.

""Poor academic performance and boredom are contributing factors, too.""

Those with a family history of serious mental disorders, such as schizophrenia,
bipolar disorders and depression, are also considered high-risk individuals.

It all boils down to the concept of ""happy family, healthy family"", says Dr
Swamenathan.

""Parents should practise an authoritative type of parenting, where love,
respect, discipline, happiness, concern, care, communication and assistance are
fostered.

""Parents should set an example, as they are powerful role models for their
children.

""Parents who smoke have the added responsibility of explaining the hazards of
smoking and admitting their mistake in doing so.

""They should discuss the dangers involved, check on their children's friends and
observe their activities, and set limits.""

Rekindle Therapy counselling psychologist Cathie Wu concurs.

""Vaping exposes youth to physiological addiction to nicotine, as well as
psychological addiction.

""Physiologically, nicotine intake increases levels of the neurochemical dopamine
and activates the reward centre in the brain to produce a sensation of pleasure.

""Through repeated use, the body becomes more tolerant to the substance and
dependence increases (resulting in heavier use).

""Psychological addiction occurs when youth associate vaping with pleasure,
stress reduction, social acceptance or a positive self-image, thus, leading to
compulsive use.""

She says studies show that the adolescent brain is more prone to be influenced
by rewards.

""Substances stimulate the reward centre in the brain.

""Additionally, vapers may be 'rewarded' with peer approval and social acceptance
when they engage in this behaviour, which can lead to dependence and addiction.""

She says many adults vape as an alternative to smoking cigarettes in attempts to
quit the latter, as the mixture used in vaping is considered less harmful than
tobacco.

However, an increasing number of youth who are not smokers are joining the ""
vaping culture"".

Wu says recent research shows that youth who vape are more likely to become
smokers later on, making vaping a possible gateway to smoking.

""There are common characteristics in people who are susceptible to addiction,
although there are no clearly-defined traits that directly result in addiction.

""Studies show that common factors in the genetic make-up, as well as the
personality traits of impulsiveness, difficulty in delaying gratification, low
self-esteem and social alienation, play a role.""

She says parents need to be united in having a continuous dialogue with their
children about addiction and the negative effects it has on the family.

""Schools may play a collaborative role in helping children overcome addiction.

""It is important to note that relying solely on punishment will not stop the
behaviour, as there may be many reasons that lead a child to the addiction.

""When it comes to helping children make a change, a positive, supportive and
empathic attitude is required.

""Parents should model positive behaviour themselves, and be prepared to seek
professional help for their children to overcome or prevent addiction.""

`Adolescent brain is vulnerable'

DR Sivakumar Thurairajasingam, an addiction psychiatrist specialist based in
Johor Baru, sheds light on the issue.

Question: There have been reports on schoolchildren vaping on school premises.
Do you believe that vaping, like smoking, can become an addictive behaviour?

Answer: Vaping devices that contain nicotine can lead to ""neuroplastic"" changes
in the adolescent brain, as the substance is addictive. Thus, early exposure
could prime the adolescent brain for the rewarding effects of drugs, leading to
an increased risk of cigarette smoking.

Question: Are schoolchildren more vulnerable to addictive behaviour? If so, why?

Answer: The adolescent brain is generally vulnerable to addictive substances, as
it is in the phase where the brain is beginning to develop and is susceptible to
drugs.

The frontal cortex, which, in humans, is in charge of making decisions and
judgments, has yet to be completely developed in adolescents, which can lead to
youngsters being easily influenced by their peers.

Once the brain has been exposed to the rewarding effects of drugs,
""neuroplastic"" changes begin. Clinical data shows us that early exposure to
drugs leads to high chances of an addiction problem later in life.

Question: Many are of the opinion that vaping is not detrimental to health, with
some parents even allowing the habit. What is your opinion?

Answer: The safety of vaping is a controversial topic. According to the National
Institute of Drug Abuse and the Mayo Clinic, the known adverse effects of vaping
overshadow any benefits. Though studies have compared the side effects of vaping
to other smoking-cessation methods, such as nicotine replacement, the results
vary depending on the products available.

The Food and Drug Administration has detected harmful levels of carcinogens and
toxins in ""e-fluids"", especially in the ""e-juice"" used in vaping devices.

The use of such devices simulates the behaviour of smoking, the vapour simulates
tobacco smoke, and the handling of the device simulates the hand-to-mouth
experience, among other comparisons.

The behavioural theory of addiction proves that addiction among the young can
begin from modelling, thus, smoking-like behaviour can lead to smoking
cigarettes and serve as a gateway to using other addictive substances.

Question: In your opinion, what group of children is most at risk of joining the
""vaping culture""?

Answer: I presume that those most at risk would be children with a lack of
supervision at home, poor parental bonding, disruptive family dynamics and,
definitely, a family history of smoking.

Question: When it comes to those between 8 and 17, what are the best ways to
help them overcome an addiction or kick a bad habit?

Answer: Prevention is always the best. Ironically, and in contradiction to the
philosophy of most people, punishment and fear never dissuade children from
addiction. Conversely, they only increase children's curiosity and the
likelihood of their eventual involvement in drugs.

Methods used internationally include education in schools and the community on
the effects and dangers of drugs. Other evidence-based treatments include taking
a behavioural approach, such as life skills, and a family-based approach, as
well as cognitive behavioural therapy.

Curiosity leads to addiction

IVAN (not his real name), 16, started vaping because it looked ""cool"".

His older brother was doing it at home, and Ivan himself tried it for the first
time in his bedroom.

""I just wanted to try it, as it didn't seem to hurt my brother in any way. My
parents do not know that my 25-year-old brother vapes, as they are at work most
of the time.

""I was drawn to it because of the sweet smell of the vapour produced. Soon
after, I introduced my school friend to it. We used our allowance to buy our own
devices and 'e-liquid'.

""We would vape after school or futsal practice.""

However, Ivan and his friend got hooked on the habit, and were not able to stay
away from vaping on school premises.

""We attend an international school in Selangor. They are not strict about most
things.

""We can keep our hair long and colour it, and bring handphones to school. So, we
thought it would be okay to bring our vaping devices.

""One day, we had to stay back for tennis practice after school, so we started
vaping in one of the empty classrooms. It was for only 10 minutes, but a student
ratted us out.

""The disciplinary teacher came to the classroom and took away our vaping
devices. He told us he would call our parents if it happened again.""

The experience did not stop Ivan from vaping and he admits to doing so outside
school premises.

""I still vape. We do it on the other side of the school fence. No one can say
anything about it, as it's outside the school.""

Another teen, who wants to be known only as Karen, 14, started vaping just five
months ago, but is already hooked.

""I love vaping. It's a nice feeling and everyone I know is doing it.

""My parents don't know about it, but my dad smokes cigarettes, so what's the
difference?""

She admits to vaping in the school bathroom during breaks.

""I don't think I'll get caught. Many students vape behind the school. If I get
caught and they confiscate my device, I'll get another one. It's no big deal, as
it is not that expensive.""

Bangor Public Health launches anti-vaping campaign

BYLINE: Evan Belanger BDN Staff

LENGTH: 798 words","


BANGOR, Maine -- In its latest effort to keep people from vaping, Bangor Public
Health and Community Services has launched a new campaign designed to warn the
public of the potential health hazards of electronic cigarettes.


The new campaign targets both children and adults throughout the Bangor area and
includes public service announcements for television, radio and Internet.
Electronic cigarettes are battery-operated devices that use a small heating
element to vaporize liquid nicotine and other substances, which are inhaled by
the user.


""While there are still many unknowns about the risks and possible benefits of
e-cigarettes and vape devices, we do know these products have the potential to
negatively impact young people,"" said BPHCS Health Promotion Manager Jamie
Comstock.


At a cost of nearly $10,000, the campaign is funded through grants from Healthy
Maine Partnerships and the federal Drug-Free Communities Program, according to
Robin Carr-Slauenwhite, Bangor public health's substance abuse prevention
coordinator.


According to Comstock, manufacturers of vaping devices are attempting to
re-normalize smoking culture by marketing vaping products as a safe alternative
and by targeting young people with candy flavored e-liquids and celebrity
endorsements.


""Exposure to nicotine may affect brain development and lead to nicotine
addiction,"" she said.


The campaign offers ""toolkits"" for local schools that include anti-vaping
materials such as posters and sample language for anti-vaping policies.


It also includes two videos -- one targeting youths and one targeting adults --
that claim e-cigarette vapor contains formaldehyde, lead, the toxic metal
cadmium and other harmful substances.


According to a survey released in April by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, electronic cigarette use by middle and high school students
tripled from 2013 to 2014.


In all, about 2 million high school students and 450,000 middle school students
said they had vaped at least once in the past 30 days, the CDC reports.


Asked about the new campaign, Dustin Fitzpatrick, owner of Vapeway, a vaping
shop in Bangor, said the liquid used in vaping devices -- known as e-liquid or
e-juice -- contains only four ingredients, compared to more than 4,000
substances contained in cigarette smoke.


""Mathematically, when a lot of people will say that vaping is 10 times more
dangerous than smoking cigarettes, that's almost impossible,"" he said.


According to manufacturers, most e-liquids contain either vegetable glycerin or
propylene glycol -- both common food additives -- nicotine and natural or
artificial flavoring.


The CDC reports that propylene glycol is generally considered safe and is
contained in many foods, drugs and cosmetics.


However, the Mayo Clinic Nicotine Dependence Center reports that there is no
long-term safety data showing the impact of repeated inhalation of propylene
glycol or vegetable glycerin on lung tissue.


Fitzpatrick said he smoked a pack of cigarettes a day until he switched to
vaping more than two years ago.


Since then, he says he has personally experienced the health benefits of vaping
as opposed to smoking, feeling increased lung capacity, increased energy,
improved senses of taste and smell and fewer bouts of cold and flu.


""We have converted very many smokers who have been extremely satisfied with the
results that they've seen from quitting smoking and switching to vaping,""
Fitzpatrick said.


Both Comstock and BPHCS Director Patty Hamilton have said publicly that studies
on the health effects of vaping are conflicting, but Hamilton said in June she
would rather err on the side of caution when it comes to vaping.


In January, a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine said
researchers had detected formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, when they tested an
electronic cigarette at high voltages.


But one of the authors has since disputed media reports that claimed the paper
meant vaping was more dangerous than traditional cigarettes, saying no such
statement was made by the researchers.


The researchers reported no formaldehyde was found when they tested the device
at lower voltages but advised users should not assume safety when it comes to
vaping.


The new campaign comes after members of the Bangor City Council discussed in
June an ordinance that would prohibit vaping in all areas where smoking is
currently banned under state law.


Hamilton said this week that the city is abandoning that proposed ordinance
since the Maine Legislature added vaping to the state's smoking laws this year.


Unlike the state law, the Bangor ordinance would have banned smoking and vaping
within 20 feet of playgrounds and picnic areas in all city parks. Both
activities are currently allowed in city parks.

Why we should regulate vaping

BYLINE: A Jalil Hamid

SECTION: Viewpoint; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 793 words","


THERE are restaurants in Kuala Lumpur offering an area to cater to people who
""vape"". That's the term used for inhaling water vapour through an e-cigarette or
other personal vaporiser.

Instead of tobacco, customers choose from an array of flavoured liquids to go
into their e-cigarettes.

One customer says he used to smoke a pack of cigarettes every two days but
switched to vaping several months ago.

It doesn't smell like tobacco smoke and those who ""vape"" say it can taste like
whatever you want.

Unlike in other countries, there are no regulations on vaping in Malaysia. But
anti-vaping campaigners say it's too much like smoking and have even called for
an outright ban, like Singapore is doing.

It also looks like there's a real tug of war going on, even among the
authorities, on how to deal with the fast-emerging vaping culture.

The e-cigs market is also rapidly expanding, both in the United Kingdom and the
United States, although little is known so far about the possible long-term
health consequences of vaping.

For sure, vaping is a fast-growing business in Malaysia with, some people say, a
bright future. But the industry is so disorganised and is faced with many
unregulated and arguably dangerous products.

Mevta, or the Malaysia E-Vaporisers and Tobacco Alternative Association, says
there are now one million e-cig consumers in Malaysia, and that the industry has
generated some RM2 billion in revenue. It says Malaysia is now the second
biggest market in the world after the US.

There are more than 1,000 vape shops and vaping outlets in the country offering
about 400 local brands of e-vaporisers and ""juice"" (nicotine infused liquids).

Obviously, the pro-vaping lobby is very strong in Malaysia, scuttling any
efforts so far by the Health Ministry to impose a ban on e-cigs.

Just a few days ago, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam told the
nation that his ministry was looking at various options, including a total ban
on vaping.

But he failed to get the cabinet, at its weekly meeting on Friday morning, to
endorse a total ban on e-cigs and vaping.

By Friday evening, Rural and Regional Development Minister Datuk Seri Ismail
Sabri Yaakob was thanking Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak on Facebook for
his understanding on the issue.

Ismail Sabri said vaping was not even banned in the UK and that smokers were
encouraged to switch to vaping due to the low nicotine content.

Dr Subramaniam countered, telling this paper that despite the ministry's failure
to get the cabinet's nod for a ban, it would apply the same set of rules
governing the use of tobacco in order to curb vaping.

He said he was deeply concerned about the ""number of people vaping in Malaysia
and its possible long-term consequences"".

This sentiment was shared by other cabinet ministers.

""There is a need to regulate. Personally, I am concerned of the social and
health impact,"" said one.

""But more facts are needed before prescribing the regulations.""

Dr Subramaniam said a ban was still possible in the future, adding that the
cabinet fully recognised the health effects of cigarette smoking and vaping.

If it adopts the tobacco-like rules, the ministry will ban the use of e-cigs in
areas where it is not allowed to use traditional cigarettes. It may also
prohibit the sale of e-vaporiser products to minors. It would make it illegal
for minors to possess vaping products.

It would also limit where you can vape. The prohibited areas include schools,
hospitals, air-conditioned restaurants, offices and cinemas, and on buses,
trains and planes.

The Health Ministry may also impose other regulations, such as compulsory
ingredients listing and limiting the levels of certain flavourings.

This is particularly so as flavoured products might make e-cigarettes more
attractive to young people.

Reports in other countries have suggested that vaping is becoming increasingly
popular among teenagers, even among those who have not previously smoked
traditional cigarettes.

Some industry people felt that Dr Subramaniam got his arguments wrong by
focusing on the ""possible"" health dangers of vaping.

""The vape protectors have slammed him back by saying he should ban cigarettes,
too. His argument should have been on the addictiveness of the product.""

So far, the battle against the ban and the regulations has been fought by
small-time e-vaporiser traders, a move that could later benefit the three big
cigarette companies.

The Big Three also produce these vaping products but they have not been
introduced in Malaysia yet. They might enter this market once all the
regulations are in place.

Right now, it is a niche and growing market. Imagine when it goes mainstream and
retail, with vaping products available in every 7-Eleven store and petrol
service station. Time will tell.

All riled up in smoke over vape

BYLINE: Azura Abas

LENGTH: 625 words","


AS things are on hyper mode in Kuala Lumpur for the 27th Asean Summit, Putrajaya
is experiencing another sort of happening.

The federal administrative capital has been a popular destination lately among
the supporters of vape, with nearly 20,000 who planned to converge here last
month had the cabinet decided to ban vaping.

When it was not banned on Oct 30, there was no reason for the ""pro-vapers"" to
gather here. But, that was not the case. Some, including a group of e-cigarette
and vape traders, still made their way to Putrajaya to submit a memorandum to
the health minister. They also threatened legal action against those who made
negative statements on vaping and e-cigarettes without proof. The group has
engaged at least two lawyers to do just this.

The Health Ministry, in a briefing on Wednesday, stated that there was a
difference between vaping and smoking e-cigarettes. One is considered vaping if
the e-juice used does not contain nicotine, and if it does, then it is a matter
of smoking e-cigarettes.

Personally, I cannot differentiate between vaping and smoking e-cigarettes
because both involve smoke being exhaled by smokers. Since I am a non-smoker, my
empathy for those who smoke is low as I cannot understand why anyone would want
to inhale smoke. The smoking realm remains a great mystery for me. When I saw a
smoke-filled vehicle with the occupants vaping away without winding down their
windows here in Putrajaya recently, the first thought that came to my mind was,
how could they breathe in there?

As a mother, I am worried for my son as he is exposed to the thick smoke when we
walk in public areas. And I am seeing more and more vapers everywhere. They
proudly display their vape kit on the tables at restaurants and, for those
familiar with vaping, the price of the kits can reach up to thousands of
ringgit.

During the ministry's briefing, we were told of cases involving children who
accidentally drank the e-juice containing nicotine. This is one of the reasons
why the ministry is concerned about the trend and has raised the need to child
proof the e-juice bottle. I am mortified at the thought of a child accidentally
drinking the e-juice.

In the United States alone there were 3,000 such cases last year. Health experts
claim a child could have a seizure, or in a worst case scenario, die, after
consuming nicotine e-juice.

Putrajaya is caught in a catch-22 situation as the ""pro-vapers"" claim vaping or
smoking e-cigarettes could help kick the habit of cigarette smoking, while the
business of selling e-juice and vape kits is lucrative. But those on the other
end of the spectrum are worried that the vaping trend would grab hold of many
young Malaysians with possible side effects to their health, and that would mean
higher healthcare cost for the country in the future. So far, 25 nations have
banned vaping and e-cigarettes.

As an advocator of health, it is understandable why the ministry is against
vaping and e-cigarette smoking or even cigarette smoking in general.

Vaping is a new trend, but it has become a craze among youth and teenagers who
have shared pictures of them vaping on Instagram and Facebook. This has raised
red flags among those in the education system with the Education Ministry saying
it would consider expulsion of students caught vaping and the Higher Education
Ministry is even mulling to ban vaping on campuses.

Vaping will be one of many issues that Putrajaya has to address and it will need
input from the relevantministries. As a non-smoker, I only hope those who are
vaping and smoking e-cigarettes will be aware of those around them especially
young children. They will see and emulate what we do. Our actions speak louder
than words.

York 'vapers' make the switch from cigarettes

Quitting smoking cigarettes was easy for Robert Jack.

A former pack-a-day smoker, the York Township resident started ""vaping"" in 2009.

An increasingly popular substitute for cigarette smoking, vaping is the act of
smoking electronic cigarettes   aka personal vaporizers, or PVs   which vaporize
a liquid solution and allow users to mimic the deep breathing and hand-to-mouth
motion of smoking.

Jack owns The York Vape Shop by Azure Vaping in West Manchester Township and
says vaping is a safe, effective way to kick the cigarette habit   and there's a
growing community of people who are making the switch locally.

""I hear every day that people feel better,"" he said. ""This is a choice that
people are really enjoying.""

Making the switch: A founding member of the White Rose Vapor Club, Jack made the
decision to switch to vaping when he ordered a basic starter kit online.

""The same day I got it, I quit smoking,"" he said.

Quitting is undoubtedly tough for smokers: Studies show that most want to quit
but aren't successful until their eighth try. Jack said vaping should be seen as
an alternative to smoking. He said he does not try to entice people to vape who
don't already smoke.

PVs come in hundreds of flavors, and the most popular at Jack's store is
hypermint, he said. The second is caramel tobacco, and there are many sweet
flavors, such as cotton candy, blueberry and Belgian waffle.

West York resident Kitty Lutman, who started vaping almost three years ago,
prefers peach nectar   it tastes like the juice out of the bottom of a peach
can, she said. A former half-pack-a-day smoker, she's only had about 10
cigarettes since she started vaping, she said.

But there is a downside: For the first two weeks, Lutman experienced quit
symptoms as her lungs and sinuses cleared out, she said. The same symptoms
happen when a tobacco user quits cold turkey.

Aside from those symptoms, she said she can climb stairs easier, feels better
and is generally happier.

""There's a very strong community behind all of vaping ... Everybody wants to
share this thing they found,"" Lutman said.

Another advocate: After getting into vaping in 2011, Michael Curry, a former
two-pack-a-day smoker, said he hasn't smoked a cigarette since.

""It's completely changed my life,"" the Hanover resident said.

After selling from kiosks around the area, Curry opened Life Smoke Vapors in
Springettsbury Township.

The company's app shows ""quit stats"" for a user, including the number of
cigarettes not smoked and money saved. He said PVs cost one-fifth the price of
regular smokes and save consumers tons of money. Beginners can start out for
about $40 to $50, plus about $1 a day for the juice that goes inside.

When Curry made the switch, he said he also noticed positive changes in his
health, such as his breathing, physical endurance and improved taste and smell.

PVs also contain addictive nicotine, a stimulant similar to caffeine, which
isn't necessarily harmful by itself. Not all contain it, and those that do can
be adjusted to alter the amount. When switching over, many cigarette smokers use
both tobacco and vaping, but Curry said within a couple days, he didn't need to.

""I was blown away by how easy it was,"" he said.

Not approved: The FDA has not approved vaping as a safe or effective method to
help smokers quit. That's why Marie Drawbaugh, tobacco treatment specialist for
WellSpan Health, said doesn't recommend PVs to smokers and would rather them use
FDA-regulated gums and patches.

Although vaping is becoming increasingly popular, its long-term outcomes are not
yet known, Drawbaugh said.

""I don't think we really know yet whether there are positives to it,"" she said.

Because PVs contain nicotine, they are not considered a tobacco cessation
product, she said. Vaping is banned at York, Memorial and Hanover hospitals
inside and outside   as part of their tobacco-free policies.

Pam Miller, tobacco cessation educator at Memorial Hospital, said she tries to
recommend the seven products that are currently FDA-approved for quitting.

""I don't recommend (vaping),"" she said in an email. ""At the same time, I educate
the patient about it, and also it is a behavior change, which is good.""

But Adam Bennett, tobacco cessation coordinator at Hanover Hospital, said he
lets his patients know vaping is a very real alternative to traditional burned
cigarettes.

""It is one option if they choose to use it, but it does carry potential for
risk,"" he said.

Knowing that there are more than 7,000 chemicals in cigarettes and much fewer in
PVs, vaping is less harmful when you weigh the two apples-to-apples, he said.
Bennett said that, until more research trickles out, those interested in vaping
should talk to their physicians to weigh the pros and cons.

""There may be a spot at the table for vaping,"" he said.

Looking forward: Curry said he believes once FDA research comes out, it and
other organizations are going to approve of PVs.

""I tend to think in the future, we're gonna see a lot of associations in the
future really taking to them,"" he said.

Jack predicts that in five to 10 years, there will be more vapers than smokers
in the country and worldwide. In the last four years, it has gone from a niche
market of tens of thousands of users to millions of users, he said.

Jack spoke in front of the FDA in December 2012 about new technology for
combating tobacco. He's a member of AEMSA, which is directly involved in helping
set standards for the juice that goes in PVs.

""We actually want certain forms of regulation in our industry,"" he said. ""It's
kind of the wild west out there.""

Govt has not decided whether to ban vaping, says Dr Hilmi

LENGTH: 274 words","


The government has not decided on whether to ban or regulate the sale of vape or
e-cigarette at the moment, Deputy Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahaya
said.

He said the ministry needs to discuss with all the related stakeholders who are
involved in the tobacco, vaping and shisha business as they are related.

""Like cigarettes, vapes contain nicotine. So if we ban vaping, what is the
action on tobacco?"" Dr Hilmi told reporters at the Parliament lobby yesterday.

He said the ministry is in the middle of creating a new law to regulate the use
of tobacco, vaping and shisha, but it is too early to draw conclusions on the
matter.

""It is too early to say we will completely ban vaping. Currently, the laws on
tobacco are under the 1993 Food Act, which is inadequate in dealing with vaping
and shisha,"" the deputy minister said.

On Tuesday, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam caused a stir when he
said his ministry plans to implement a blanket ban on e-cigarettes, or vaping.
He said it is the ministry's goal to ban vaping before it becomes a major health
issue.

The National Fatwa Council was reported as saying that vaping is prohibited in
Islam as like cigarettes, vape could also pose a health risk.

Vaping has turned from a fad into a multimillion ringgit industry in the
country.

Vaporizer Convention Kuala Lumpur 2015 co-organiser Ibrahim Mohamed recently
said that Malaysia's vape industry, worth RM500 million, is the second-biggest
globally after the US and is the largest in Asia.

Ibrahim reportedly said there are an estimated one million vapers in Malaysia,
and that the practice has helped them quit smoking.

Letters to the editor: Banning vaping makes no sense

SECTION: LETTERS

LENGTH: 911 words","


The Welsh government's proposal to ban the use of e-cigarettes - or ""vaping"" as
it is known - in public places and workplaces is illogical.

It is widely acknowledged that e-cigarettes are much safer for the user than
cigarettes - with as little as one per cent of the risks associated with smoking
- and far less irritating to other people nearby. Smokers should be encouraged
to switch to using e-cigarettes but such a ban would remove an important
incentive to change.

E-cigarettes do not make smoking ""normal"" again, as some anti-smoking
campaigners maintain. Rather, their increased use and visibility would make
e-cigarettes the norm for those who enjoy nicotine. Nor are e-cigarettes a
""gateway"" to smoking - they are, in fact, a powerful aid to stopping smoking.

The Welsh proposal shows that many people in government and public health are
more interested in controlling our behaviour than promoting our health.Rob
Lyons, campaigns manager, Action on Consumer Choice

The proposal to ban vaping in indoor public areas is based on assumptions that
are not supported by the evidence. The idea that it poses a risk to health to be
near someone vaping is not supported by evidence - the concentrations of toxins
are too low to pose a significant health risk to bystanders under any but the
most extreme conditions.

Additionally, vaping shows that attempts to stop smoking and motivation to stop
are at least as high now as they were before vaping became popular, and there
has been no increase in the violation of indoor smoking bans.

Vaping does not act as a gateway to smoking among young people - the use of
e-cigarettes among people who hadn't smoked before in the UK is extremely rare -
and smoking rates for young people continue to fall as fast as ever.  Public
health legislation based on gut feelings and vague worries threatens to
undermine the credibility of public health.Professor Robert West, director of
tobacco research, University College London

If vaping becomes normalised and smoking becomes more marginalised, isn't that a
good thing? Banning vaping jeopardises the massive potential of vaping in
reducing the numbers of cigarette smokers faster than any other campaign or aid
in history.James

Nick Curtis says he supports a public ban on vaping because he fears it will
""renormalise"" smoking. This gets to the crux of the matter, as it's not the
danger they pose which bothers anti-smokers but the open display - which was the
real reason for the smoking ban.Steve Lustig

Let Ukip members take part in Pride

RE Ukip being excluded from this year's Pride [June 10], the answer - though not
ethically obvious - is simple. Pride is not a march to promote political
interests but is a way for people of differing sexual or gender orientations to
come together and unite in solidarity.

Creating factions and excluding people within from an otherwise solid front
sends a message that not all people in the LGBT community are equal. If Ukip did
march, the party itself would have to admit that some of its members are LGBT,
allowing them to have their say within their own party.

Anyone who is a part of the LGBT community or supports it should be allowed to
march for the greater good of challenging opinions and promoting acceptance.

Even allowing for differences of opinion, those who promote causes have always
achieved more by uniting people and encouraging acceptance and tolerance rather
than allowing exclusion.

After all, Pride started as a challenge to accepted viewpoints about sexuality
and it should continue to serve this purpose.Anna Heath

We need action on pollution now

It was good to see your coverage of the House of Commons debate on air pollution
[Letters, June 9]. Part of the problem is that local authorities have to pay the
EU fines for air pollution but do not have the power to do anything about making
the air cleaner.

As for City Hall, it has so far failed to create the network of electric car
charging points Boris Johnson promised, which would have reduced diesel cars on
roads. As well as this, the Ultra Low Emissions Zone is scheduled for so far in
the future that it's no help to those suffering today.

I'm pleased that this vitally important subject was granted time in the Commons
but this public-health crisis, which causes 3,000 premature deaths a year in
London, needs action, not just words.Rupa Huq, MP for Ealing Central and Acton
(Lab)

Scientist's remarks were unacceptable

The recent comments by Sir Tim Hunt, the 2001 Nobel Prize-winner for his work in
biochemistry, were totally unacceptable and is another example of discrimination
against women in academic research.

Being aware of gender discrimination in society is not just a feminist issue but
one that is relevant to everyone and especially to those holding an important
role in science and, by extension, society.Dr Delphine Deryng, University of
East Anglia

The only way to tackle knife crime

Following your coverage of the latest tragic knifing [""Dalston stabbing: man
fighting for life after being stabbed multiple times in east London"", June 6],
we would like to offer our response.

As a society, our first response is retribution, ever harsher punishment and to
tell young people to put their knives away. But none of these work as a
deterrent.

We need to tell our young people that they are valued and they do matter. We
need to involve them in their communities so they care about the people around
them.Barry and Margaret Mizen MBEs, Foundation for Jimmy

'Vaping' business coming to downtown Shamokin

BYLINE: Rob Wheary, The News-Item, Shamokin, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 386 words","


Sept. 06--SHAMOKIN -- A new business that caters to the popular practice of ""
vaping"" is kicking off a revitalization of business in one section of downtown
Shamokin.

Black Hills Vapes, located along Station Row at 136 E. Independence St., will
hold an official grand opening Tuesday, but the company has actually been in
operation since March.

""In an effort to quit smoking, I started vaping and fell in love with it,"" said
Christopher Walters, who co-owns the store with Steve Jacobs.

""Vaping"" is short for ""vaporizing."" Those who ""vape"" place a flavored liquid
inside a small tank. The device then heats up the liquid, turning it into a
vapor, which the user then inhales and exhales, like one would do with tobacco.

""The biggest difference between tobacco smoking and vaping is there are no
combustible elements here because nothing is burning,"" Walters explained.

Unlike cigarettes, vaping is different because of the makeup of the vaping
liquid, Walters and Jacobs said..

""The liquid is made up of four basic ingredients -- water, flavoring, vegetable
glycerin and propylene glycol,"" Jacobs said. ""Not like tobacco, which has
thousands of harmful chemicals in it.""

For those who are trying to quit smoking, Walters said it gives the same effect
as inhaling smoke.

""We have about 51 different flavors available at the store, and we continue to
expand that number,"" Walters said. ""The best thing about it is you can vape in
places where they don't allow smoking indoors. The odor is not offensive and
doesn't hang on your clothes.""

Tuesday's grand opening will feature samples, raffles and giveaways.

Black Hills Vapes is the second business to open on Station Row in the last few
months. Recently, LC Nutrition -- a nutritional supplement store, opened, and
there are plans for a third business opening within the next month or two.

""We had so much help to open the store and getting it ready,"" Jacobs said. ""Our
regular customers couldn't wait for us. We looked at some other locations, but
we hoped we could spark some revitalization in the town, and it looks like it's
working.""

Black Hills Vapes will be open from noon to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday and
noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.

Pahang wants vape ban

BYLINE: Nor Ain Mohamed Radhi

SECTION: Pg. 29

LENGTH: 245 words","


KUANTAN: THE Pahang Islamic Religious and Malay Customs Council (Muip) will
raise the electronic cigarettes and vaping issue with the state Fatwa Council
for a resolution to prohibit the use of the devices at mosques and office
premises in the state.

Muip deputy president Datuk Seri Wan Abdul Wahid Wan Hassan said such a move was
needed to curb vaping in mosques and offices.

""Lately, vape users have been vaping freely in mosques and offices, causing
discomfort to those near them. We hope the state Fatwa Council will also issue
an edict to ban vaping in other public places, such as restaurants,"" he said
yesterday.

Wahid said vaping, which had become popular, must be stopped.

""Besides harming one's health, vaping leads to financial wastage as a vaporiser
can cost hundreds of ringgit, even thousands.""

He said Muip had issued an order forbidding employees and visitors to vape at
its council's premises.

On Friday, the Penang Fatwa Council ruled the use of vape and shisha as haram
and banned them.

On Nov 29, Johor became the first state to ban vaping following a royal decree
by Sultan of Johor, Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, who ordered the closure of
premises selling vape equipment and vaping liquids beginning next year.

On Nov 23, the Kedah Fatwa Committee also banned vaping and shisha among
Muslims.

Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Idris Jusoh on Nov 22 said vaping had been
banned in all 20 public universities after a meeting with vice-chancellors.

E-cigarette shops win vaping-ban exemption

BYLINE: Elise Stolte, Edmonton Journal

SECTION: CITY &; REGION; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 313 words","


Vaping advocates found relief at city hall Wednesday as council voted to exempt
shops that sell e-cigarettes from a ban on vaping in public.

City staff will rewrite the proposed bylaw so that customers will be able to try
ecigarettes in shops whose only purpose is to sell vaping supplies.

Advocates had been arguing for the change, saying customers who want to use
vaping as a way to quit smoking tobacco need to try out the products before they
buy it.

""This is a win today so we will take it and move on,"" said Atul Kalia, who owns
two e-cigarette shops in Edmonton. Buying vaping supplies requires a lot of
testing and trouble shooting, he said, before customers get the right mix and
products they're satisfied with.

His shops, Lifestyle Cig, sell only vaping supplies and have their own
ventilation system.

""Most reasonable people would agree this is a harmreduction strategy,"" said
Coun. Scott McKeen, supporting the motion.

Other councillors called it a compromise position until Health Canada comes out
with a more definitive answer on whether vaping has harmful health effects or
not, perhaps moving the sale of e-cigarettes to pharmacies. Many were also
concerned about the language of the bylaw, wanting to make sure only specific
vaping stores would be included.

""How do we make sure that doesn't turn into a vape café?"" said Mayor Don Iveson.

Coun. Bryan Anderson proposed the exemption, saying defeating a smoking
addiction is a very difficult thing to do.

""I congratulate those who have found a way to quit smoking,"" he said. ""I would
hate myself if there were people who had found a way to quit smoking that
including vaping and I stood in the way.""

The bylaw will come straight back to city council for approval when the wording
around the exemption is finalized.

Popularity of e-cigarettes gives rise to 'vaping' lounges

BYLINE: By Barbara Boyer and Ben Finley; Inquirer Staff Writers

SECTION: PHILADELPHIA; P-com News Local; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 1113 words","


Kyra Donaldson, a 20-year-old from Mount Laurel who takes part in the growing
vaping lifestyle, thinks her cloud can match those produced by men, despite
their stronger lung capacity.

And when she partakes, she often goes to Popie's Vapor Lounge in Marlton.

""I come here every day. It's relaxing. For me, it's like going to a coffee
shop,"" she said at Popie's tasting bar, where she was with friend Duncan
DiTullio, also 20 and from Mount Laurel.

She filled the canister of her ""e-cig"" with a menthol drip and soon was
enveloped in a thick fog. It was impressive.

DiTullio did the same, puffing rings that took form before evaporating.

Once a fringe indulgence, e-cigarettes have become a more than billion-dollar
business nationwide.

In the last two years, vaping lounges have sprouted in the suburbs of New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, and in Center City and the South Street corridor.

Vaping products are in demand, and momentum is building as big tobacco companies
begin investing in e-cigarettes. Some predict sales of vapor products will
surpass tobacco within a decade.

Government at all levels has taken notice and has struggled to find appropriate
ways to regulate and tax vaping.

New Jersey has already outlawed selling to those younger than 19, and Gov.
Christie has proposed taxing vaping products at higher levels, similar to
cigarettes.

This month in Philadelphia, Mayor Nutter signed bills that outlaw sales to
minors within the city and prohibit vaping in workplaces, bars, restaurants, and
other public places.

And last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced proposed new
regulations that would forbid the sale of vaping products to those younger than
18.

Though some say the FDA is moving too slowly, those who vape are less concerned.

They support regulation to make sure products are safe but feel increasing taxes
would be misguided. The lifestyle, they say, does away with smoking cigarettes,
which is known to cause cancer.

Vaping is considerably less expensive, and high taxes could discourage smokers
from trying the alternative.

At Popie's on Wednesday, Donaldson and DiTullio were unconcerned as they sat
with owner Robert Eichenberger, 38, comparing flavors and the hardware that
vaporizes the nicotine solution.

Blowing vapor plumes that looked like smoke, the three were among the born-again
who swear vaping allowed them to quit smoking.

""We're getting this nicotine without cigarettes, thank the Lord,"" Eichenberger
said, arms raised. He started smoking at 14 and tried quitting for years until
he started vaping. ""I'm a recovering cigarette addict.""

Eichenberger, who formerly owned a construction business, and his wife, Heidi,
39, a medical professional, opened Popie's more than a year ago. The foggy
retreat is filled with a bouquet of sweet aromas where they educate new
customers and allow them to try vaping. They have a steady flow of new and
return customers, many of whom arrive at lunch or after work to vape.

""It's a new frontier. It's run by new people,"" said DiTullio, a critic of big
tobacco.

Donaldson began vaping six months ago.

""I drip a menthol flavor, so it's minty. I feel so much healthier,"" she said.
She enjoys cycling and said she now has more endurance.

Those at Popie's are among legions of nicotine users who say they vape to keep
away from cigarettes, which stained their teeth, stressed their lungs, and left
a disgusting stench on their clothing.

Christina Craine, 35, of Lindenwold, and her friend David Gordon, 47, of
Collingswood, were also at Popie's last week. Gordon, a light smoker, quickly
appreciated the advantages of flavor vaping.

""This is much more enjoyable,"" Gordon said. ""I smoked a cigarette a couple of
weeks ago and it was absolutely disgusting. Absolutely nauseating.""

Craine is more dependent on nicotine and said she had ""a moment"" when her
e-cigarette clogged. She bought a larger, more expensive model and keeps two
less expensive backups.

Electronic cigarettes come in all sizes and colors - hot pink, sky blue, black,
chrome. There are petite models that appeal to soccer moms. Designs also include
skulls for the alternative crowd.

The devices use a lithium battery-operated igniter that heats the nicotine juice
so the vapor can be inhaled. Users select the nicotine level they prefer. The
variation of flavors seems endless, including applejack, Swedish fish, and
Turkish tobacco.

John Mikhail, 29, of King of Prussia, was at the World's Finest Vape Shop in
Bridgeport, Montgomery County, on Wednesday for a fruit flavor called ""Dragon's
Blood.""

He was in the 10th day of his ninth try at quitting Newports. Although he
believes vaping may be better than cigarettes, he is still concerned about the
potential side effects of vaping.

Research suggests some vaping products are safer than cigarettes and can help
reduce nicotine consumption, but experts warn the long-term effects are unknown.

""Anyone who is vaping may be using something harmful, or not harmful. We really
can't say,"" said Thomas Glynn, director of cancer science and trends for the
American Cancer Society.

He cited a recent New Zealand study that showed vaping may help wean smokers off
cigarettes within six months with no apparent adverse short-term health effects.

Because the sale of vapor products is not strongly regulated, however, the
ingredients vary significantly among manufacturers. The FDA tested some juices
and found dangerous carcinogens.

The American Cancer Society does not endorse the use of e-cigarettes, pending
more research.

Vape shops are now open in South Philadelphia and Center City, mostly catering
to those in their 20s and 30s.

Paul Vu, manager of Vapordelphia at Ninth and South Streets, said business had
been better than expected.

Darius Nguyen, a manager at the Exclusive Vape Shop on South Street, said vaping
sells itself. ""You're presenting a form of nicotine that is so much healthier
than regular cigarettes.""

Someone who smokes a pack a day might start with 18 milligrams of nicotine,
while a light smoker might prefer six. Those who want to quit can slowly reduce
the nicotine.

On Wednesday, Lynne Palmer, 39, of South Philadelphia, visited Exclusive Vape.
She ordinarily buys online and said she started vaping for health reasons.

""I'm turning 40 this year, and one of the things I have is good skin, and that
changes if you keep smoking,"" she said. Quitting smoking ""just makes you feel a
lot better. You can actually taste food now.""

Popularity of e-cigarettes gives rise to 'vaping' lounges

Kyra Donaldson, a 20-year-old from Mount Laurel who takes part in the growing
vaping lifestyle, thinks her cloud can match those produced by men, despite
their stronger lung capacity.

And when she partakes, she often goes to Popie's Vapor Lounge in Marlton.

""I come here every day. It's relaxing. For me, it's like going to a coffee
shop,"" she said at Popie's tasting bar, where she was with friend Duncan
DiTullio, also 20 and from Mount Laurel.

She filled the canister of her ""e-cig"" with a menthol drip and soon was
enveloped in a thick fog. It was impressive.

DiTullio did the same, puffing rings that took form before evaporating.

Once a fringe indulgence, e-cigarettes have become a more than billion-dollar
business nationwide.

In the last two years, vaping lounges have sprouted in the suburbs of New Jersey
and Pennsylvania, and in Center City and the South Street corridor.

Vaping products are in demand, and momentum is building as big tobacco companies
begin investing in e-cigarettes. Some predict sales of vapor products will
surpass tobacco within a decade.

Government at all levels has taken notice and has struggled to find appropriate
ways to regulate and tax vaping.

New Jersey has already outlawed selling to those younger than 19, and Gov.
Christie has proposed taxing vaping products at higher levels, similar to
cigarettes.

This month in Philadelphia, Mayor Nutter signed bills that outlaw sales to
minors within the city and prohibit vaping in workplaces, bars, restaurants, and
other public places.

And last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced proposed new
regulations that would forbid the sale of vaping products to those younger than
18.

Though some say the FDA is moving too slowly, those who vape are less concerned.

They support regulation to make sure products are safe but feel increasing taxes
would be misguided. The lifestyle, they say, does away with smoking cigarettes,
which is known to cause cancer.

Vaping is considerably less expensive, and high taxes could discourage smokers
from trying the alternative.

At Popie's on Wednesday, Donaldson and DiTullio were unconcerned as they sat
with owner Robert Eichenberger, 38, comparing flavors and the hardware that
vaporizes the nicotine solution.

Blowing vapor plumes that looked like smoke, the three were among the born-again
who swear vaping allowed them to quit smoking.

""We're getting this nicotine without cigarettes, thank the Lord,"" Eichenberger
said, arms raised. He started smoking at 14 and tried quitting for years until
he started vaping. ""I'm a recovering cigarette addict.""

Eichenberger, who formerly owned a construction business, and his wife, Heidi,
39, a medical professional, opened Popie's more than a year ago. The foggy
retreat is filled with a bouquet of sweet aromas where they educate new
customers and allow them to try vaping. They have a steady flow of new and
return customers, many of whom arrive at lunch or after work to vape.

""It's a new frontier. It's run by new people,"" said DiTullio, a critic of big
tobacco.

Donaldson began vaping six months ago.

""I drip a menthol flavor, so it's minty. I feel so much healthier,"" she said.
She enjoys cycling and said she now has more endurance.

Those at Popie's are among legions of nicotine users who say they vape to keep
away from cigarettes, which stained their teeth, stressed their lungs, and left
a disgusting stench on their clothing.

Christina Craine, 35, of Lindenwold, and her friend David Gordon, 47, of
Collingswood, were also at Popie's last week. Gordon, a light smoker, quickly
appreciated the advantages of flavor vaping.

""This is much more enjoyable,"" Gordon said. ""I smoked a cigarette a couple of
weeks ago and it was absolutely disgusting. Absolutely nauseating.""

Craine is more dependent on nicotine and said she had ""a moment"" when her
e-cigarette clogged. She bought a larger, more expensive model and keeps two
less expensive backups.

Electronic cigarettes come in all sizes and colors - hot pink, sky blue, black,
chrome. There are petite models that appeal to soccer moms. Designs also include
skulls for the alternative crowd.

The devices use a lithium battery-operated igniter that heats the nicotine juice
so the vapor can be inhaled. Users select the nicotine level they prefer. The
variation of flavors seems endless, including applejack, Swedish fish, and
Turkish tobacco.

John Mikhail, 29, of King of Prussia, was at the World's Finest Vape Shop in
Bridgeport, Montgomery County, on Wednesday for a fruit flavor called ""Dragon's
Blood.""

He was in the 10th day of his ninth try at quitting Newports. Although he
believes vaping may be better than cigarettes, he is still concerned about the
potential side effects of vaping.

Research suggests some vaping products are safer than cigarettes and can help
reduce nicotine consumption, but experts warn the long-term effects are unknown.

""Anyone who is vaping may be using something harmful, or not harmful. We really
can't say,"" said Thomas Glynn, director of cancer science and trends for the
American Cancer Society.

He cited a recent New Zealand study that showed vaping may help wean smokers off
cigarettes within six months with no apparent adverse short-term health effects.

Because the sale of vapor products is not strongly regulated, however, the
ingredients vary significantly among manufacturers. The FDA tested some juices
and found dangerous carcinogens.

The American Cancer Society does not endorse the use of e-cigarettes, pending
more research.

Vape shops are now open in South Philadelphia and Center City, mostly catering
to those in their 20s and 30s.

Paul Vu, manager of Vapordelphia at Ninth and South Streets, said business had
been better than expected.

Darius Nguyen, a manager at the Exclusive Vape Shop on South Street, said vaping
sells itself. ""You're presenting a form of nicotine that is so much healthier
than regular cigarettes.""

Someone who smokes a pack a day might start with 18 milligrams of nicotine,
while a light smoker might prefer six. Those who want to quit can slowly reduce
the nicotine.

On Wednesday, Lynne Palmer, 39, of South Philadelphia, visited Exclusive Vape.
She ordinarily buys online and said she started vaping for health reasons.

""I'm turning 40 this year, and one of the things I have is good skin, and that
changes if you keep smoking,"" she said. Quitting smoking ""just makes you feel a
lot better. You can actually taste food now.""

Couple starts vaping, e-cigarettes business in Schuylkill Haven

BYLINE: Amy Marchiano, Republican & Herald, Pottsville, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 613 words","


April 22--SCHUYLKILL HAVEN -- The borough now has its own vaping store to cater
to those who use electronic cigarettes and similar products.

Black Flag Vapors, 35 E. Main St., opened April 7 and sells more than 400
different flavors of e-liquid for e-cigarettes. The owners, Paul Schmura and
Elizabeth Barlet, said they want to give people an opportunity to try something
new.

Schmura said smoking cigarettes is bad because the products contain unknown
chemicals. Schmura and Barlet said they are up-front about what is in the
e-liquids they sell and list the ingredients on the bottle.

The e-liquids include flavoring, vegetable glycerin and food-grade propylene
glycol. The couple said they do not sell to people under 18 because the liquids
usually contain nicotine.

Barlet said a majority of their customers either want to stop smoking tobacco
products or are interested in the vaping hobby. The idea for the store started
after Schmura concluded that purchasing e-liquid over the Internet for his own
use was getting too expensive. So he did research and started making his own.
Schmura and Barlet then decided to open a store. The couple has a month-to-month
lease but plan to stay for a long time, Barlet said.

For those who want to try vaping, the couple usually recommends the E-go's, an
e-cigarette. A starter kit costs about $35 and includes the battery, charger,
e-cigarette and carrying case. The e-liquid goes into a tank or a cartomizer. A
coil acts as the heating element for the device. Most e-cigarettes have a
lithium ion battery as the power source. There are also modifications such as a
microchip to regulate the amount of concentrated vapor emitted in each puff.

Schmura said they also teach people how to use the devices they buy.

On the health consequences of vaping, Schmura said, ""There is a safety risk in
almost anything that you do.""

He said he thinks vaping is safer than smoking cigarettes.

The Food and Drug Administration said there is not enough information about
e-cigarettes to guarantee they are a safer alternative to cigarettes, and it is
unknown if using vaping products can prompt young people to experiment with
cigarettes.

Bartlet said she has customers who come into the store because their doctors
recommended they try vaping instead of smoking cigarettes.

""I see how it's helping people,"" Schmura said, regarding vaping products helping
customers cut down on cigarette use and the chemicals used in them.

Known side effects from the use of e-cigarettes include headaches for those who
are sensitive or allergic to the propylene glycol and vaper's tongue, which is a
condition meaning a user can no longer taste the vapor, Barlet said.

Gov. Tom Wolf proposed in his budget address a 40 percent tax on the wholesale
price of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. The couple said that is not a
wise idea.

""We think it is really a bad idea because you're looking at something that is
bringing in jobs and it's creating revenue already. If he taxes 40 percent,
what's going to happen are people are going to go out of state or they are going
to buy online to get stuff cheaper, so he's going to diminish all those jobs
that were just created,"" Barlet said.

Schmura agreed, saying, ""He's going to chase revenue out of PA.""

The couple said they try to keep prices low.

Hours for the store are as follows: closed on Monday; 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday; noon to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday; and 10 a.m. to 3
p.m. Sunday. Visit the website at www.BlackFlagVapors.com.

Clear ruling on vaping needed

BYLINE: Mohamed Azam

SECTION: Comment; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 942 words","


THE issue on ""vaping"" or smoking e-cigarettes has recently attracted much debate
in Malaysia. Many youngsters are picking up this trend for two reasons: as a
cheaper alternative to smoking cigarettes (whose prices have gone up
exorbitantly), and as a means to quit smoking.

The cabinet has recently come to a decision that there is no plan to make vaping
illegal. The Ministry of Health, however, did issue a statement that both
cigarettes and vapes are enormously harmful as they contain nicotine - which is
medically proven to lead to cancer.

Due to the fact that vaping and its electronic accessories only recently
penetrated the Malaysian market, fatwas on this particular practice are
relatively few.

At present, only the Federal Territory has issued a clear ruling forbidding
vapes. Its mufti, Datuk Dr Zulkifli Mohamad al-Bakri, has argued that vaping is
very similar to smoking a cigarette. Using the analogy that smoking cigarettes
is haram because it is detrimental to health, he concludes that vaping is also
forbidden. Such practice clearly causes harm (mafsadah), and this contradicts
the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, as well as the objectives of Shariah
(Maqasid al-Shari'ah). Allah says in the Quran: ""And spend in the way of Allah
and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by
refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good"" (195:
al-Baqarah). Such a reminder is also be emphasised in another verse, ""O you who
have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided for you and be
grateful to Allah if it is [indeed] Him that you worship"" (al-Baqarah: 172).

In the Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad said that ""La dharar wala dhirar"", which
means that ""there should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm"" (Narrated by
Ahmad, Malik, Ibn Majah & al-Daraquni). Another point to consider is the Islamic
legal maxim ""dar'ul mafasid muqaddamun 'ala jalbi al-masoleh"" (preventing damage
takes priority over obtaining benefit).

Overall, vaping is an act that leads to harmfulness in both the short term and
long term. Such practice is highly prohibited, because Islam teaches its
followers to protect their faith, life, intellect, posterity and wealth. These
protections are derived from the highest ranking of Maqasid, namely the
necessities or essentials (Dharuriyyat).

The decision to prohibit vaping can be simply based on the analogy with the
conventional cigarettes - both carry the same result: harmfulness.

Recently, deputy director-general of Health Datuk Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman made
a very vigorous statement on vaping. Because vaping is relatively new in this
country, there is no law on it yet and no concrete local studies on its
long-term effects. Currently, the ministry's technical committee is still
studying and researching its health effects. However, he stresses that there are
sufficient worldwide studies showing that vaping is harmful, and based on this,
the committee has advised the ministry to ban vapes.

It is better to take precautionary steps, rather than to realise the bad effects
of vaping later. Citing the case of cigarettes, World Health Organisation
scientists only found out in the 1960s that smoking causes lung cancer, but
people had already been smoking for the past 100 years.

The ministry also believes that this new practice can lead to addiction, thus it
had proposed to the government to ban e-cigarettes or vaping on the grounds that
it has high chances to become a ""gateway"" to smoking tobacco cigarettes,
especially among the younger age group. Such a measure had already been taken in
our neighbouring countries like Thailand and Cambodia, and in other developed
nations like the United States and several European countries.

However, the proposal was turned down by the cabinet simply because it wanted
further studies to be carried out before any decision is made. Yet, even without
a ban, stiff action had already been carried out by the Ministry of Health in
the form of large-scale (and controversial) raids against vape suppliers due to
unapproved levels of nicotine which is controlled under the Poisons Act of 1952
(Revised 1989).

The National Fatwa Council has yet to come out with a clear ruling on vaping.
Fatwas forbidding smoking (1995) and shisha (2013) were issued by the National
Fatwa Council and some State Fatwa Committees, but not on vaping. The statement
by Professor Emeritus Tan Sri Dr Abdul Shukor Husin, chairman of the National
Fatwa Council, that e-cigarettes and vapes could be equated with smoking and
shisha is insufficient at the institutional level.

An alarming report presented at the Vaporizer Convention in Kuala Lumpur in June
mentioned that the Malaysian vape industry is worth more than half a billion
ringgit, the second biggest in the world after the US and the largest in Asia,
with an estimated one million vapers in Malaysia. Despite some vapers claiming
that this practice can help them to quit smoking, the obvious high health risk
of inhaling smoke particles and chemical fumes are undeniable.

I conclude with the suggestion that the National Fatwa Council and respective
State Fatwa Committees come out with a clear fatwa on e-cigarettes and vapes. In
addition, it is advisable for the government to introduce strict measures and
regulations on vaping, as well as close monitoring of the nicotine content in
vaping liquids. Prohibiting vaping can block the means (Sad al-Zari'ah) of
damage (mafsadah) it can cause to personal health and society (among others),
ensuring the benefit (maslahah) of mankind.

E-cigarettes a good alternative to smoking the real thing

LENGTH: 506  words","

DATELINE: Camarillo


CSU Channel Islands has issued the following news release:


In recent months, vaping has grown increasing popular among a wide variety of
users, marijuana wax included, all over the country. Vaping, a close cousin of
the typical cigarette, heats liquid nicotine with not as much of the tar and rat
poison as regular cigarettes.


On Jan. 28, the California Department of Health released a warning suggesting
that ""e-cigarettes emit cancer-causing chemicals and get users hooked on
nicotine.""
Formaldehyde and aerosol are among the chemicals swept into the air. Exposure is
implied after prolonged inhalation, not after a single slug.
A recent article released by the Associated Press suggests that, ""A state
senator introduced legislation this week that would regulate e-cigarettes as
tobacco products and ban their use in public places such as hospitals, bars and
schools. A similar bill was defeated last year over opposition from tobacco
companies.""
Vaping continues to grow rapidly along many age groups as well. A grave concern
about this product is that it appeals to young children because it offers a wide
variety of succulent flavors like peaches and cream and orange dreamsicle.
Child deaths from the consumption of liquid nicotine rose from ""seven to 154 in
2012"" according to the Associated Press.
In recent ploys to target parents, many anti e-cigarette crusaders suggest that
flavoring of tobacco products or vaping products appeal to kids.
Another argument against vaping is that it leads to the smoking of actual
cigarettes, the prolonged use ones that cause cancer and high blood pressure. It
doesn't take a scientist to know that cigarettes smell like crap, so why would
people make a jump to smoking actual cigarettes when vaping essentially gives
you the nicotine kick that you want and or need?
They wouldn't. Unless they didn't like the nicotine levels ingested with the
vaping products.
A plus side to vaping is that it helps chronic smokers substitute cigarettes
with the obvious less harmless side effects of e-cigarettes.
In a recent ""Mike and Dr. Drew from Loveline"" podcast, episode 93 featured the
CEO of Craft Vapery, Josh Krane who discussed the benefits of vaping, which
helped him quit smoking two packs of cigarettes daily.
""For me, its not only a way to scratch the itch for the nicotine it keeps me
from eating, it satisfies something larger than I was getting with just
cigarettes alone,"" said Krane in the podcast.
My beef isn't with vaping itself, but the fact that California wants to ban
vaping in public places just because there are assumptions that it might cause
cancer and kill you. Or that your kids might like it because it's flavored like
the cereal they eat, which is probably worse for them.
I'd rather have this next generation addicted to vaping than cigarettes.
The effects of vaping are inconclusive, but our government insists on assuming
that kids will get hooked, and I say ""so what?""

Stoney Creek e-cigarette shop fears possible provincial vaping ban

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1286  words","


Tina Brink hopes the province's new e-cigarette regulations won't vaporize her
thriving Stoney Creek business.

The use of e-cigarettes, commonly called ""vaping,"" has been cited as tool to
help smokers quit.

As of Jan. 1, e-cigarette retailers are forbidden from selling their products to
anyone under 19, a regulation that Brink's business, and the Canadian Vaping
Association, has upheld from day one.

But a potential ban on vaping in public and in vape shops, plus the possible
prohibition on the display of e-cigarette products, could threaten the existence
of vape shops, said Brink.

Brink, who co-owns Stoney Creek's Quitters Vape Shop with her husband, Frank,
was a 30-year tobacco smoker before purchasing her first e-cigarette unit.

After one day of vaping, Brink said she's never had the urge to return to
tobacco.

Brink said she can't market e-cigarettes as smoking cessation products and can't
advertise on Facebook because she sells products that contain pharmaceutical
grade nicotine. That puts her at a disadvantage when compared with mainstream
smoking cessation products.

""We can't make medical claims. It's an alternative to smoking that's less
harmful. That's how we market it.""

Quitters Vape Shop has been open for about 18 months, first on King Street in
downtown Stoney Creek before moving to its current location on Highway 8. Brink
said the business has about 3,000 customers.

In Ontario, Bill 45, section three, regulates e-cigarettes. So far, the only
regulations retailers must follow govern the sale of products only to those 19
and over, plus the mandatory display of signage.

The legislation, which has already received Royal Assent, includes the provision
that ""No person shall use an electronic cigarette in any enclosed public place
or enclosed workplace.""

On Dec. 16, associate health minister Dipika Damerla told CBC News the province
would not be immediately moving forward with banning vaping in places where
smoking is prohibited.

Damerla said the government is reviewing regulations around where medical
marijuana can be vaped and ""in that context we've just made the decision to
bring all of the regulations around where you can and cannot vape at once.""

Vape shop owners like Brink fear the reprieve could be temporary and that staff
could be forced to ask customers to vape outside. At Quitters Vape Shop, that
would mean customers vaping near a child care centre.

Brink said it's essential for adult customers to see the product and to receive
an in-store demonstration.

""If we can't trouble shoot when they're having problems, they're just going to
go back to smoking,"" she said.

Brink said her store doesn't market products to non-smokers and discourages
anyone looking to vape on a recreational basis. Many of her customers are over
40.

""Even people who come in who don't smoke, we try to suggest that they don't
start vaping. Because why would you put something foreign in your lungs. There's
nothing better than air.""

Along with a battery-powered e-cigarette, vaping includes the use of an e-liquid
or e-juice that is composed of a mixture of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin
and pharmaceutical grade nicotine. Water soluble, natural and artificial
flavouring ingredients are added to the e-liquid base to create flavours.

Instead of shutting down the industry, Brink hopes governments will refocus
efforts on eliminating chemicals like diacetyl from e-liquids, while
establishing universal product standards.

""Make it safe. Make it better. That's what we want,"" she said.

The health risks of vaping have been widely debated, with some researchers
stating the practice is safer than smoking, while others say no studies exist to
prove vaping is a safe way to quit smoking.

Dr. Scott Wooder, a Stoney Creek family physician and past president of the
Ontario Medicial Association, supports legislation to ban vaping where smoking
is prohibited. Wooder also spoke out last fall, when the provincial Liberals
moved to ban flavoured tobacco.

""I support the legislation for what it does about flavoured tobacco, but also
for the e-cigarettes. They're doing the right thing there,"" said Wooder.

Wooder doesn't recommend e-cigarettes to patients looking to quit smoking.

""First of all, if a patient comes to me and tells me he wants to quit smoking, I
want to do everything I can to help him. So I would maybe point out some
alternatives that are tested. They're safe and effective.""

Wooder said the most common examples are oral medications and nicotine
replacement therapy.

""These have been tested. And they're safe and effective. E-cigarettes haven't
been tested as a way to stop smoking. And we don't know anything about their
effectiveness. And worse, we don't know anything about their safety.""

Wooder said public use of e-cigarettes normalizes their use.

""It makes it seem like it's an acceptable thing to do for children, for
teenagers. That's one thing we shouldn't be doing. We just got to the point
where it's socially unacceptable to smoke in public. It looks odd to see someone
smoke in a public place. I don't like what I see with e-cigarettes. It's
becoming acceptable again.""

The Canadian Vaping Association, a registered national, not-for-profit
organization responsible for the management of government and media relations on
behalf of the Canadian vaping industry, argues vaping is safer than smoking,
with virtually no second-hand side effects, because water vapour, not smoke, is
emitted.

""We are convinced that vaping is a significantly healthier choice than smoking,""
CVA president Beju Lakhani states in an Oct. 2015 news release. ""Based on
qualified literature, studies and research on this topic, vaping is 95 per cent
safer than smoking and has virtually no second-hand effects.""

Vaping supporters often cite the findings of Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos from
the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens, Greece. A study by Farsalinos in
the Journal of Nicotine and Tobacco Research evaluated the presence of two
inhalation toxins, diacetyl and acetyl propionyl, in e-cigarette liquids.
Researchers obtained 159 e-liquid samples, from 36 manufacturers and seven
countries.

The study found 74 per cent of the samples contained either diacetyl or acetyl
propionyl, with more samples containing diacetyl. The levels were, on average,
slightly lower than currently established safety limits set by the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Lakhani has also pointed to research by pulmonologist Dr. Gaston Ostiguy at the
Montreal Chest Institute that judged the efficacy of vaping in the fight against
smoking. More than 40 per cent of tobacco users under Ostiguy's care reportedly
used vaping to stop smoking.

Brink said she tried conventional smoking cessation products, like oral
medication and a nicotine patch, which gave her nightmares and left a red blotch
when she pulled it off.

She stands behind her products and rejects claims that users will migrate from
e-cigarettes to tobacco. ""Why would you go to smoking when this tastes so much
better?"" she said.

Like provincial governments, federal politicians have also been slow to react to
the emerging e-cigarette industry.

Last March, the House of Commons health committee issued a report calling for
regulation, while also upholding the rights of users to continue vaping.

While calling for new laws to end the legal gray area around the industry in
Canada, the committee urged a new set of rules to balance the risks and benefits
of vaping. The committee noted laws should limit e-cigarette advertising and
stipulate that e-cigarettes cannot resemble tobacco cigarettes. While upholding
a vaping ban in public places, the committee recommended that laws should not
unduly discourage adult smokers from trying vaping.

thriving Stoney Creek business.

The use of e-cigarettes, commonly called ""vaping,"" has been cited as a tool to
help smokers quit.

As of Jan. 1, e-cigarette retailers are forbidden from selling their products to
anyone under 19, a regulation that Brink's business, and the Canadian Vaping
Association, has upheld from day one.

But a potential ban on vaping in public and in vape shops, plus the possible
prohibition on the display of e-cigarette products, could threaten the existence
of vape shops, said Brink.

Brink, who co-owns Stoney Creek's Quitters Vape Shop with her husband, Frank,
was a 30-year tobacco smoker before purchasing her first e-cigarette unit.

After one day of vaping, Brink said she's never had the urge to return to
tobacco.

Brink said she can't market e-cigarettes as smoking cessation products and can't
advertise on Facebook because she sells products that contain pharmaceutical
grade nicotine. That puts her at a disadvantage when compared with mainstream
smoking cessation products.

""We can't make medical claims. It's an alternative to smoking that's less
harmful. That's how we market it.""

Quitters Vape Shop has been open for about 18 months, first on King Street in
downtown Stoney Creek before moving to its current location on Highway 8. Brink
said the business has about 3,000 customers.

In Ontario, Bill 45, section three, regulates e-cigarettes. So far, the only
regulations retailers must follow govern the sale of products only to those 19
and over, plus the mandatory display of signage.

The legislation, which has already received Royal Assent, includes the provision
that ""No person shall use an electronic cigarette in any enclosed public place
or enclosed workplace.""

On Dec. 16, associate health minister Dipika Damerla told CBC News the province
would not be immediately moving forward with banning vaping in places where
smoking is prohibited.

Damerla said the government is reviewing regulations around where medical
marijuana can be vaped and ""in that context we've just made the decision to
bring all of the regulations around where you can and cannot vape at once.""

Vape shop owners like Brink fear the reprieve could be temporary and that staff
could be forced to ask customers to vape outside. At Quitters Vape Shop, that
would mean customers vaping near a child care centre.

Brink said it's essential for adult customers to see the product and to receive
an in-store demonstration.

""If we can't trouble shoot when they're having problems, they're just going to
go back to smoking,"" she said.

Brink said her store doesn't market products to non-smokers and discourages
anyone looking to vape on a recreational basis. Many of her customers are over
40.

""Even people who come in who don't smoke, we try to suggest that they don't
start vaping. Because why would you put something foreign in your lungs. There's
nothing better than air.""

Along with a battery-powered e-cigarette, vaping includes the use of an e-liquid
or e-juice that is composed of a mixture of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin
and pharmaceutical grade nicotine. Water soluble, natural and artificial
flavouring ingredients are added to the e-liquid base to create flavours.

Instead of shutting down the industry, Brink hopes governments will refocus
efforts on eliminating chemicals like diacetyl from e-liquids, while
establishing universal product standards.

""Make it safe. Make it better. That's what we want,"" she said.

The health risks of vaping have been widely debated, with some researchers
stating the practice is safer than smoking, while others say no studies exist to
prove vaping is a safe way to quit smoking.

Dr. Scott Wooder, a Stoney Creek family physician and past president of the
Ontario Medicial Association, supports legislation to ban vaping where smoking
is prohibited. Wooder also spoke out last fall, when the provincial Liberals
moved to ban flavoured tobacco.

""I support the legislation for what it does about flavoured tobacco, but also
for the e-cigarettes. They're doing the right thing there,"" said Wooder.

Wooder doesn't recommend e-cigarettes to patients looking to quit smoking.

""First of all, if a patient comes to me and tells me he wants to quit smoking, I
want to do everything I can to help him. So I would maybe point out some
alternatives that are tested. They're safe and effective.""

Wooder said the most common examples are oral medications and nicotine
replacement therapy.

""These have been tested. And they're safe and effective. E-cigarettes haven't
been tested as a way to stop smoking. And we don't know anything about their
effectiveness. And worse, we don't know anything about their safety.""

Wooder said public use of e-cigarettes normalizes their use.

""It makes it seem like it's an acceptable thing to do for children, for
teenagers. That's one thing we shouldn't be doing. We just got to the point
where it's socially unacceptable to smoke in public. It looks odd to see someone
smoke in a public place. I don't like what I see with e-cigarettes. It's
becoming acceptable again.""

The Canadian Vaping Association, a registered national, not-for-profit
organization responsible for the management of government and media relations on
behalf of the Canadian vaping industry, argues vaping is safer than smoking,
with virtually no second-hand side effects, because water vapour, not smoke, is
emitted.

""We are convinced that vaping is a significantly healthier choice than smoking,""
CVA president Beju Lakhani states in an Oct. 2015 news release. ""Based on
qualified literature, studies and research on this topic, vaping is 95 per cent
safer than smoking and has virtually no second-hand effects.""

Vaping supporters often cite the findings of Dr. Konstantinos Farsalinos from
the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center in Athens, Greece. A study by Farsalinos in
the Journal of Nicotine and Tobacco Research evaluated the presence of two
inhalation toxins, diacetyl and acetyl propionyl, in e-cigarette liquids.
Researchers obtained 159 e-liquid samples, from 36 manufacturers and seven
countries.

The study found 74 per cent of the samples contained either diacetyl or acetyl
propionyl, with more samples containing diacetyl. The levels were, on average,
slightly lower than currently established safety limits set by the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Lakhani has also pointed to research by pulmonologist Dr. Gaston Ostiguy at the
Montreal Chest Institute that judged the efficacy of vaping in the fight against
smoking. More than 40 per cent of tobacco users under Ostiguy's care reportedly
used vaping to stop smoking.

Brink said she tried conventional smoking cessation products, like oral
medication and a nicotine patch, which gave her nightmares and left a red blotch
when she pulled it off.

She stands behind her products and rejects claims that users will migrate from
e-cigarettes to tobacco. ""Why would you go to smoking when this tastes so much
better?"" she said.

Like provincial governments, federal politicians have also been slow to react to
the emerging e-cigarette industry.

Last March, the House of Commons health committee issued a report calling for
regulation, while also upholding the rights of users to continue vaping.

While calling for new laws to end the legal gray area around the industry in
Canada, the committee urged a new set of rules to balance the risks and benefits
of vaping. The committee noted laws should limit e-cigarette advertising and
stipulate that e-cigarettes cannot resemble tobacco cigarettes. While upholding
a vaping ban in public places, the committee recommended that laws should not
unduly discourage adult smokers from trying vaping.

Kedah won't ban vaping

SECTION: Pg. 24

LENGTH: 599 words","


ALOR STAR: There are no plans to ban vaping in the state.

State Environment, Chinese and Indian Community Affairs, Health, and Solidarity
Committee chairman Datuk Dr Leong Yong Kong said they would wait for a
nationwide ruling.

Meanwhile, Selangor is mulling whether to ban vaping.

A workshop on vaping will be held in Shah Alam early next year, where health
professionals and youth would put forward their viewpoints.

Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Azmin Ali said he had instructed the state executive
councillor in charge of health, welfare, women and family affairs Dr Daroyah
Alwi to organise the workshop, which would involve the Health Ministry, youth
associations and non-governmental organisations.

""We want to listen to the conclusion reached at the workshop before making any
decision. We do not want to make hasty decisions without listening to feedback
from professionals, especially doctors.

""We also want to hear what youth have to say,"" he said after attending the state
Economic Action Council meeting here yesterday.

Johor was the first state to ban vaping, effective Jan 1. Kelantan and Trengganu
cracked down on vaping with a freeze on business licences for e-cigarettes.
Kuching is mulling the proposal to ban vaping.

Assistan Public Health Minister Datuk Dr Jerip Susil said the proposal would be
tabled in the next state cabinet meeting after research on vape was completed.

""Besides the research and studies from our department, we need reviews, from the
state Education Department, following concerns about vaping among students in
schools.

""The state government is considering whether to follow Johor's lead and ban
vaping. We need feedback from other departments as well.""

Jerip said the initiative would prevent the use of liquids as drugs among the
younger generation.

In Johor, police seized 6,924 bottles of vaping liquid and 190 vaping devices
and accessories worth more than RM380,000 in several raids on Tuesday.

Four men, aged between 23 and 70, were arrested.

State police chief Datuk Wan Ahmad Najmuddin Mohd told a press conference at the
state police headquarters here yesterday that the items were seized under the
Poisons Act 1952, which is a federal law.

""The vape liquids are believed to contain nicotine. That is a threat to public
health. Therefore, it is an offence under the Poisons Act.""

Wan Ahmad Najmuddin rebutted claims that the items were seized following the
state government's sale ban, which comes into force on Jan 1.

""We are not enforcing the law under the state government's ban on selling vaping
devices and accessories.""

He was responding to the statement by Small and Medium Entrepreneurs Association
of Malaysia (Ikhlas) president Mohd Ridzuan Abdullah, who said on Wednesday that
they planned to sue the state government for seizing vaping devices, accessories
and liquid.

Ridzuan said traders had suffered huge losses from the raids and seizures, and
appealed for the items to be returned.

Wan Ahmad Najmuddin said Ridzuan's statement was akin to challenging the Johor
police, the state's leading authority on law enforcement. However, he said
police were not going to call up Ridzuan.

""He (Ridzuan) can talk. Let's see him challenge the Kelantan government and
police next, which has also banned the sale of vape.""

Other government agencies taking part in the raids were the Johor Baru City
Council, Johor Health Department, state Domestic Trade, Cooperative and
Consumerism Ministry, Johor Customs Department and Johor Companies Commission of
Malaysia.

He said disciplinary action would be taken against police officers caught vaping
in police stations.

Vaping Cafés - The latest trend or just a fad?

LENGTH: 427  words","


Monica Or, columnist and Hospitality Consultant at Star Quality Hospitality
Consultancy discusses how a new trend is emerging as Cafes are now catering for
those that wish to partake in vaping..What is ""vaping""? I hear you ask. Well it
is the term used for those of you that currently smoke and in your attempts to
give up and lead a healthier lifestyle you have turned to using electronic
cigarettes, commonly known as e-cigarettes.

In 2007 the UK Government introduced the No Smoking Law which as hospitality
operators we have gotten used to and made the necessary adjustments to
accommodate this. In many cases this has meant our guests who are smokers have
to stand outside to get their nicotine fix. Due to this legislation the use of
e-cigarettes has increased as it means that people can still ""smoke"" using these
devices indoors. There are still some exceptions, for example JD Wetherspoon
pubs do not allow the use of e-cigarettes as the vapour emitted from them can be
mistaken for cigarette smoke.Recently several establishments have turned
themselves in to Vaping Cafés. This means that they sell a variety of flavoured
e-cigarettes in their premises and allow their customers to try before they buy,
and have a ""smoke"" whilst enjoying their coffee and cake.What is believed to be
London's first e-cigarette coffee shop ""The Vape Lab"" opened in Shoreditch in
March this year. A few months later ""The Vaping Café"" opened in Tunbridge Wells,
and news just out says that Bolton will be opening their own vaping café called
""The Flavour Vapour Café"".There is huge debate about the use of e-cigarettes and
if they really are a healthy alternative to smoking cigarettes. Do they really
help people to quit smoking? Or do the variety of flavours now actually enhance
the idea of smoking to the younger generation which may entice them to taking up
the habit?Likewise are Vaping Cafés the latest trend to take off in the world of
coffee shops or just a fad? Will we start to see Vaping Restaurants and have
these in our hotels? For me personally, the Vaping Cafés are a way to get around
the No Smoking Law - however the whole point of introducing this law is to
encourage people to lead healthier life styles by giving up smoking in the first
place. The government are doing more and more to make smoking less appealing to
the general public whilst the introduction of Vaping Cafés seems to be doing the
opposite.Like the idea of loathe the idea, Vaping Cafés have now arrived.© 2014

'Vaping' has gone mainstream - linguistically, at least; Few printed
dictionaries include the word yet, but it seems destined to last

BYLINE: MARK ABLEY, The Gazette

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Watchwords; Pg. E5

LENGTH: 690 words","


You know a word has gone mainstream when it forms part of an official message
sent out by McGill University. This month, the word ""vaping"" achieved that
distinction. ""With the advent of so-called e-cigarettes, or electronic
cigarettes,"" declared the message from the university's communications office,
""some in our community have asked whether McGill's policy with regard to smoking
applies to 'vaping' or the use of electronic cigarettes. It does.""

The message is a model for how to introduce a term into public discourse. It not
only deploys the word ""vaping,"" it explains it. Even the most dyed-in-the-wool
opponent of language change could hardly complain that the McGill email left the
meaning of ""vaping"" unclear - as long as you grasp the concept of e-cigarettes,
of course. (I admit, it took me a while.) The first time the word appeared in
The Montreal Gazette, the meaning was not quite so clear. A story originally
written for the New York Times, and published in June 2013, stated: ""While
e-cigarettes are still a fraction of the $80 billion-a-year market for smoking
products in the United States, the growing popularity of vaping, as the practice
is known, has touched offa clash in Europe between retailers and regulators.""

""Vaping"" has been on the radar screen of linguists, and smokers, for a few years
now. Back in 2009 an entry on the Urban Dictionary website of slang defined
vaping as ""the process by which one inhales vapour from a personal vaporizer, or
e-cig."" Within the past year, definitions have arisen on the site - possibly in
jest - for offshoot expressions such as ""vape porn"" (""the act of showing your
personalized electronic cigarette to the vaping community so that it can be
appreciated"") and ""vape ape"" (""an enthusiastic user of electronic cigarettes,
asserting moral and esthetic superiority over traditional tobacco smokers""). Its
brevity serves the word well; three-and four-syllable terms often become
established slowly.

In this newspaper, the word ""vaping"" appeared three times in 2013 and has
already been used at least 10 times in 2014. By August, it was deemed familiar
enough to warrant a front-page headline: ""Putting tighter leash on vaping."" Few
printed dictionaries include the word as yet, but it's easy to find definitions
online.

The Oxford Dictionaries site, for instance, provides the following example for
the verb ""to vape:"" ""I'd rather people vaped indoors than smoked outside.""

Some new words emerge with a bang and die with a whimper. Vape and vaping are
unlikely to be among them; they are good candidates to last.

I'm familiar with the New Orleans Times-Picayune. I'm acquainted with the
Tombstone Epitaph. But as a connoisseur of newspaper names, I didn't know about
a breathtaking example from North Carolina until my former Gazette colleague
Frank Mackey enlightened me: a century ago, a paper in the western part of that
state was called the French Broad Hustler.

It sounds too absurd to be true, yet it's not. The French Broad is a river that
runs through Tennessee and North Carolina. It flows across land once claimed by

France, unlike its neighbour, the Broad River, formerly the English Broad. As
for ""hustler,"" its connotations have not always been of the sleazy or downright
criminal type. A hustler can be a person full of energy, ambition, drive. In
1886, not long before the French Broad Hustler was launched, an ad appeared in
the magazine Publishers' Weekly stating: ""Young man, a 'hustler' in every
respect, wants a strictly first-class position with a 'live' book house."" It's
interesting to know that even then, some book publishers were as good as dead.

Hendersonville, the small town served by the French Broad Hustler during the
first two decades of the 20th century, has a different self-image today. It
markets itself as the ""Friendliest City for Retirees in America."" Perhaps one of
those retirees could edit a website that promises: ""Downtown you'll discover a
flourishing Main road complete with ... obsolescent saves, and loads of
specialists and symbolization exhibitions."" markabley@sympatico.ca !@COPYRIGHT=©

E-cigarettes a good alternative to smoking the real thing

LENGTH: 506  words","

DATELINE: Camarillo


CSU Channel Islands has issued the following news release:

In recent months, vaping has grown increasing popular among a wide variety of
users, marijuana wax included, all over the country. Vaping, a close cousin of
the typical cigarette, heats liquid nicotine with not as much of the tar and rat
poison as regular cigarettes.
On Jan. 28, the California Department of Health released a warning suggesting
that ""e-cigarettes emit cancer-causing chemicals and get users hooked on
nicotine.""
Formaldehyde and aerosol are among the chemicals swept into the air. Exposure is
implied after prolonged inhalation, not after a single slug.
A recent article released by the Associated Press suggests that, ""A state
senator introduced legislation this week that would regulate e-cigarettes as
tobacco products and ban their use in public places such as hospitals, bars and
schools. A similar bill was defeated last year over opposition from tobacco
companies.""
Vaping continues to grow rapidly along many age groups as well. A grave concern
about this product is that it appeals to young children because it offers a wide
variety of succulent flavors like peaches and cream and orange dreamsicle.
Child deaths from the consumption of liquid nicotine rose from ""seven to 154 in
2012"" according to the Associated Press.
In recent ploys to target parents, many anti e-cigarette crusaders suggest that
flavoring of tobacco products or vaping products appeal to kids.
Another argument against vaping is that it leads to the smoking of actual
cigarettes, the prolonged use ones that cause cancer and high blood pressure. It
doesn't take a scientist to know that cigarettes smell like crap, so why would
people make a jump to smoking actual cigarettes when vaping essentially gives
you the nicotine kick that you want and or need?
They wouldn't. Unless they didn't like the nicotine levels ingested with the
vaping products.
A plus side to vaping is that it helps chronic smokers substitute cigarettes
with the obvious less harmless side effects of e-cigarettes.
In a recent ""Mike and Dr. Drew from Loveline"" podcast, episode 93 featured the
CEO of Craft Vapery, Josh Krane who discussed the benefits of vaping, which
helped him quit smoking two packs of cigarettes daily.
""For me, its not only a way to scratch the itch for the nicotine it keeps me
from eating, it satisfies something larger than I was getting with just
cigarettes alone,"" said Krane in the podcast.
My beef isn't with vaping itself, but the fact that California wants to ban
vaping in public places just because there are assumptions that it might cause
cancer and kill you. Or that your kids might like it because it's flavored like
the cereal they eat, which is probably worse for them.
I'd rather have this next generation addicted to vaping than cigarettes.
The effects of vaping are inconclusive, but our government insists on assuming
that kids will get hooked, and I say ""so what?""

The Vape debate

BYLINE: BY LAUREN A. WILLIAMS, STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A

LENGTH: 1532 words","



HIGHLIGHT: E-liquid has a strong foothold in Orange County. And health officials
are concerned.


Randy Freer is all in on the vaping business, even if he worries that pending
laws and regulations could make him go bust.

Freer's construction career dried up during the housing crisis, and he became an
entrepreneur. In spring 2013 he launched P.O.E.T., a boutique Seal Beach-based
manufacturer of e-liquid, or ""juice"" as it's called - the stuff loaded into
vaping devices to create an inhalable vapor that simulates cigarette smoke.

Freer sees himself as an artisan. Creating new flavors of vaping liquid,
""electronic nectar"" as he calls it, is akin to crafting a high-end alcoholic
beverage layered with differ-ent tastes. ""It's almost like a fine whiskey or a
fine wine,"" he said. ""You can start to pick the layers apart in the flavor
profile.""

Freer is far from alone in his enthusiasm. As vaping has caught on, it has
attracted legions of aficionados here - not only the ones who inhale the stuff
but also entrepreneurs staking their claim to a burgeoning industry. Orange
County has become a vaping hub - home to 15 percent to 20 percent of e-liquid
manufacturers in the U.S., by one estimate.

Health concerns

Not everyone, however, is as enamored of vaping as are Freer and his peers in
the business. The growing distribution of an essentially unregulated product has
drawn the attention of lawmakers, regulatory agencies, city officials and the
medical establishment.

And their scrutiny has intensified with the appearance of studies showing that
the chemicals contained in the liquid inhaled by vapers may have serious health
consequences.

One study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration showed that ""the tobacco
solution used in e-cigarettes contains a toxic chemical found in antifreeze and
several cancer-causing chemicals,"" according to cancer.net, the website of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology.

In response to these concerns, some cities in Orange County have begun to impose
restrictions on vaping.

The state Legislature is pushing to classify - and perhaps tax - vaping products
as tobacco. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has drafted regulations
that would require testing every strength of each flavor a manufacturer offers.

Under this rule, 80 variations of Freer's products would need costly laboratory
analysis that he says his small business can't afford. Freer, along with many
other vaping juice manufacturers, worries he might be forced out of the state -
or out of business entirely - because of such regulations.

""If the FDA regs roll the way they're proposed, I will find a new industry,""
Freer said.

Austin Hopper, who has worked at three big e-liquid companies in Orange County,
says proposed state legislation is too stringent. Lumping vaping liquids in with
traditional tobacco products will only damage an industry that could help people
quit smoking cigarettes, he warned.

""Being classified as tobacco is a stigma we don't need,"" Hopper said. ""It is
killing an industry that is saving people.""

Some researchers believe the opposite: that vaping may lead people to
cigarettes.

""The FDA's mandate is to protect Americans from tobacco-related disease and
death in today's rapidly evolving marketplace,"" Michael Felberbaum, a press
officer with the agency, wrote in response to an emailed question about its
pending new e-cigarette regulations.

""Under the proposed rule, all newly deemed tobacco products would require market
authorization"" from the agency, Felberbaum noted. He added that the FDA is
sympathetic to the concerns of small businesses and is proposing to stagger the
compliance dates.

O.C.'s emerging ""vapreneurs""

Many of the biggest names in the vaping industry are headquartered in Orange
County, most of them led by young entrepreneurs.

""This is our Silicon Valley of vaping - of e-liquids certainly,"" said Norm Bour,
the founder of VapeMentors, a Newport Beach-based consultancy for what he calls
""vapreneurs.""

Some e-liquid manufacturers point to the intersection of a hip emerging industry
and the area's status as a hub for drug and alcohol recovery services as the
driving force behind vaping's big foothold in Orange County.

Stores selling starter kits, e-liquid and the devices that turn it into vapor
also have proliferated in Orange County with the popularity of vaping.

Data provided by Yelp show 238 Vape shops across Orange County opened and
registered with the site over the past decade, most of them concentrated in the
northern part of the county. Anaheim spawned the most, with 35 opening and
listing on Yelp.

In 1963, the first patent for an e-cigarette was filed, but it would be four
decades before a pharmacist in China developed a more sophisticated version of
the e-cigarette. In the mid-2000s, e-cigarettes came to the U.S., and by 2009
their popularity had boomed.

By 2014, vaping had mushroomed into a $2.5 billion industry. This year the
e-cigarette market is on track to grow to $3.5 billion, said Greg Conley,
president of the New Jersey-based American Vaping Association. Most of the
people benefiting from this exploding industry are the owners of small
operations - shops employing a handful of workers.

""This is really a small business revolution,"" Conley said.

'Wild West' of vaping

When e-cigarettes first caught on, there was no body of research measuring their
health effects, and government officials were caught off guard by the need to
classify, tax and regulate them. Business owners abounded, and the quality of
the e-liquid they produced varied widely.

""It was a little bit of the Wild West when this industry started,"" said Doug
Hughes, a manufacturer and retailer of vaping products who is the co-president
of the Southern California chapter of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade
Association.

But the industry is no longer a free-for-all.

Several cities across Orange County are changing their laws to ban e-cigarette
consumption in parks and public places. Under the regulations being prepared,
the FDA is poised to crack down on free giveaways, require health warning
labels, and generally treat e-cigarettes and vaping products much like
traditional cigarettes.

Since the early days of vaping, academic studies monitoring its effects have
appeared almost weekly. Some show more dire findings; others more benign.

One study released late last month by Public Health England, a UK government
agency, found that most of the chemicals that cause smoking-related diseases are
absent in vaping and that those that are in the vapor pose less of a risk.

Earlier this year, however, the California Department of Public Health
determined that heated e-liquid delivers ultrafine particles that can become
trapped in the lungs.

More ominously, a study by the New England Journal of Medicine published in
January found the lifetime cancer risk from formaldehyde inhalation was
significantly higher for long-term vapers than for cigarette smokers.

And yet another study published last month by JAMA Pediatrics found that young
people who Vape are more likely to start smoking cigarettes.

""As an organization we are very concerned in having another generation addicted
to nicotine,"" said Cynthia Hallett, executive director of Americans for
Nonsmokers' Rights.

Vape business owners say they are concerned, too.

Freer launched the Vape Free Youth campaign and a set of standards for those in
the industry to follow. The Smoke-Free Alternatives group is pushing Age to
Vape, an effort asking businesses to hang signs in their stores showing their
commitment to keep vaping products out of the hands of children.

""These products are for adults, sold by adults, and we want to keep these out of
the hands of minors,"" said Cynthia Cabrera, the executive director of the
national Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association.

High-tech production

In preparation for stiff regulations, many manufacturers started about a year
ago to move away from amateur methods and establish high-tech labs. Hughes
estimated 10 percent of manufacturers don't have high-quality labs.

Jeffrey Nelson left a job at a pharmaceutical company to join Cosmic Fog Vapors,
a Costa Mesa-based maker of e-liquid, to prepare its facilities for a
state-of-the-art lab. And he brought his expertise on FDA regulations with him.

""I realized this is not just a trend among a generation,"" Nelson said of his
decision. ""This is a cultural shift.""

For Hopper, who has worked at three big-name e-liquid makers and recently
launched his own line, Revol, in Orange County, some regulation is welcome.

""We need to be made in a lab,"" Hopper said of the products. ""We need
regulations. We need a nomenclature that's not geared toward children.""

Stuart Christensen of Laguna Beach said if regulations sent the cost of e-liquid
skyrocketing he would stop buying it.

""I would probably try to start making my own,"" he said.

Freer worries others will return to smoking cigarettes. And he said the extra
regulations would push out the small businesses that have propelled the
industry.

At that point, ""the only kind of money that can do it is big tobacco and pharm,""
Freer said. ""This is small business, middle America latching onto brand new
technology that really is a viable technology. We're kind of the new electric
car.""

Banning vaping makes no sense

SECTION: LETTERS; Pg. 49

LENGTH: 431 words","


THE Welsh government's proposal to ban the use of e-cigarettes - or ""vaping"" as
it is known - in public places and workplaces is illogical.

It is widely acknowledged that e-cigarettes are much safer for the user than
cigarettes - with as little as one per cent of the risks associated with smoking
- and far less irritating to other people nearby. Smokers should be encouraged
to switch to using e-cigarettes but such a ban would remove an important
incentive to change.

E-cigarettes do not make smoking ""normal"" again, as some antismoking campaigners
maintain. Rather, their increased use and visibility would make e-cigarettes the
norm for those who enjoy nicotine. Nor are e-cigarettes a ""gateway"" to smoking -
they are, in fact, a powerful aid to stopping smoking.

The Welsh proposal shows that many people in government and public health are
more interested in controlling our behaviour than promoting our health.

Rob Lyons, campaigns manager, Action on Consumer Choice THE proposal to ban
vaping in indoor public areas is based on assumptions that are not supported by
the evidence. The idea that it poses a risk to health to be near someone vaping
is not supported by evidence - the concentrations of toxins are too low to pose
a significant health risk to bystanders under any but the most extreme
conditions.

Additionally, vaping shows that attempts to stop smoking and motivation to stop
are at least as high now as they were before vaping became popular, and there
has been no increase in the violation of indoor smoking bans.

Vaping does not act as a gateway to smoking among young people - the use of
e-cigarettes among people who hadn't smoked before in the UK is extremely rare -
and smoking rates for young people continue to fall as fast as ever. Public
health legislation based on gut feelings and vague worries threatens to
undermine the credibility of public health.

Professor Robert West, director of tobacco research, University College London
IF VAPING becomes normalised and smoking becomes more marginalised, isn't that a
good thing? Banning vaping jeopardises the massive potential of vaping in
reducing the numbers of cigarette smokers faster than any other campaign or aid
in history. James NICK Curtis says he supports a public ban on vaping because he
fears it will ""renormalise"" smoking. This gets to the crux of the matter, as
it's not the danger they pose which bothers antismokers but the open display -
which was the real reason for the smoking ban.

Vaping faces possible ban

SECTION: Pg. 8

LENGTH: 335 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: The Health Ministry is looking at laws to ban vaping or
e-cigarettes soon, said Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam.

When met at the Parliament lobby yesterday, he said the ministry's long-term
intention was to ban vaping.

He said an announcement would be made once the ministry had studied the legal
aspects which allowed for the ban against vaping.

He added the ministry was brainstorming with other agencies and ministries to
select the most relevant law.

""We want to choose an act that will give us maximum power to ban it. I would
like it to happen as early as possible, before it becomes a major health issue,""
he said.

In recent years, many Malaysians have picked up vaping as an alternative to
smoking.

However, several months ago, Dr Subramaniam advised Malaysians to stop vaping
until findings on the risks of smoking shisha and vaping were revealed.

Malaysian Medical Association president Dr Ashok Philips was recently reported
as saying that the medical profession would support a ban on vaping devices and
the flavoured nicotine liquid until research determined that they were indeed
harmful.

The National Fatwa Council, meanwhile, had declared vaping haram, or prohibited,
because it was dangerous, wasteful and harmful to the health.

In Malacca, Dr Subramaniam said the ministry would study the contents of vapes
before deciding whether the ban would be similar to the legislation set on
conventional cigarettes, as the contents in vapes were different from
cigarettes.

""We are studying the various options before we make that decision,"" he said
after handing over aid to the poor in conjunction with a Deepavali celebration
at Dewan Hang Tuah here yesterday.

About 405 people received RM80,000 in cash aid from the Social Welfare
Department.

Dr Subramaniam said although the ministry had not finalised the decision, the
ministry had a clear intent in working towards the ban of vaping.

Neighbouring countries, such as Brunei, Singapore and Thailand, have already
banned vapes.

Smoking or vaping - you're still addicted to nicotine

BYLINE: Drs. Oz And Roizen, The Province

SECTION: LIVE IT!; Pg. A41

LENGTH: 260 words","


Q: I quit smoking cigarettes about two years ago and started vaping nicotine
instead. I've heard that a lot less people are smoking cigarettes. Could vaping
account for the decrease in smoking?

- Ned T., Arlington, Texas

A: Bravo for getting off cigarettes, but ... we'll get to vaping nicotine in a
minute.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking
declined from around 21 per cent of adults in 2005 to about 18 per cent in 2013
and preliminary data show that it hit 16.8 per cent in 2015. And it's certainly
possible that the numbers indicate a lot of folks, like you, have switched from
cigarettes to vaping.

Some people are doing both. As for your nicotine vaping: While you may be
dodging the tar and chemical additives in cigarettes - that's a good thing -
vaping isn't harmless.

One study found that using an e-cigarette for 10 minutes made breathing more
difficult. Reduced respiration taxes your heart and your brain, which makes your
RealAge older!

The U.S. National Institutes of Health also points out nicotine is highly
addictive, and testing of some e-cigarette products found that the vapour
contained carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde,
as well as potentially toxic metal nanoparticles from the vaporizing mechanism.

Ned, we still don't know vaping's long-term effects, and you're still addicted
to nicotine.

Put down the vape and try a smoking-cessation program.

Vaping takes hold in NEPA, health benefits hazey

BYLINE: David Falchek, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1252 words","


June 07--Vaping helped Ryan Sienkiewicz and Antonio Cellar slay the scourge of
cigarettes in their lives and now they want to help others.

Their shop at the Green Ridge Plaza, Vision Vapor, selling vaporizers and the
liquids used in them, doesn't look like the sort of place for counseling. But
that's what it has become as more cigarette-addicted people turn to
e-cigarettes, and conclude that they like it, trading the shame and stigma of
being smokers for a relaxed community of fellow vapers.

While Vision Vapor is the first dedicated vaping lounge in Scranton, it joins
others that have popped up in the last three years.

Vape culture comes with a loathing of cigarettes and the addictive power it once
had over vapers. Despite a shared enemy, public health officials say vaping
trades one unhealthy vice for another. They urge caution, lobbying for more
regulation of the largely unregulated and lightly taxed vaping industry.

Quitters

""I came to the conclusion that I would die from cigarette smoking,"" said Mr.
Cellar, now just 24, but for several years a two-pack-a-day smoker. He never
intended on quitting until someone introduced him to vaping. He enjoyed it.
Quitting seemed within reach and he did.

Recently, a customer came into Vision Vapor with his adult children and asked
Mr. Cellar to show them how to quit. Mr. Cellar asks how much they normally
smoke, and recommends a level of nicotine, expressed in milligram, typically
from 3 to 12, that gets added to flavored ""juice.""

The public health community's zero tolerance for smoking substitutes and any
half measures toward quitting extends to vaping. As far as the American Lung
Association is concerned vaping has no claim to higher ground. Anthony Delonti,
American Lung Association program specialist based in Scranton, resents vape
shop staffers acting like counselors or clinicians.

""So now the vape shops are the smoking cessation experts and the apothecaries?""
Mr. Delonti said.

If it is not air, the American Lung Association feels it should not be inhaled.

""If you stop hitting yourself in the head with a hammer, and starting hitting
yourself in the head with the rubber mallet, you are still hurting yourself and
we aren't going to congratulate you,"" Mr. Delonti said. ""We are going to tell
you to stop hitting your head.""

He said vaping is just another way to deliver nicotine and get people hooked.
Nicotine, whether in liquids or tobacco, constricts blood vessels, increases
blood pressure and make the heart work harder. While shops interviewed for this
story do not serve patrons under 18 and often card visitors, Mr. Delonti thinks
the flavors are targeting kids, who find other ways to get the e-cigarettes.
Even if people vape with liquids that contain no nicotine, the act of heating
the flavor and glycol mixture causes a chemical change.

He admits the research on long-term effects of vaping are scant and just
beginning.

""People will say its water vapor, but its really a chemical aerosol,"" he said.
""We want to get in front of this because 10 years down the road, we don't want
to learn something and have people say, 'why didn't anyone warn us?'"" Groups
like the American Lung Association, physician groups, and anti-tobacco crusaders
who have aligned against vaping and e-cigarettes have lost sight of the public
health goals of saving lives, said Michael B. Siegel, M.D., professor of
community health science at Boston University.

""How strange and unfortunate that they refuse to accept the principle of harm
reduction. If you can't go all the way and quit, they'd rather you just die,""
Dr. Siegel said. ""The evidence is clear that thousands of people are cutting
back or quitting smoking because of e-cigarettes and they experience objective
improvements in lung function. But rather than acknowledge a far less harmful
behavior, these groups rather protect some moral perspective on addiction and
insist that these people must face some other penalty or pay some price.""

Swapping habits

Many patrons vape without any nicotine at all -- inhaling, basically, flavored
vapor. Smokers who vape with nicotine often find it easier to gradually wean off
entirely.

Marissa Collarini, 28, of Whites Crossing, at Vision Vapors, places her module,
or ""mod,"" to her mouth, the battery-powered wand vaporizing Fruit Rings, the
Fruit Loops-like flavored juice, into a chamber, which then she inhales.

She had quit smoking while pregnant, but slid back and could feel her health
decline. ""I couldn't even walk up my driveway,"" she says under a sweet-smelling
cloud. Last June she started vaping.

""Within a month, I felt so much better,"" she said.

Xhale Lounge manager Shane Boice, 28, likes to show chest x-rays taken as a
smoker, when the damage from this three-pack-a-day habit was evident even to a
lay person, and then later as a vaper, where his lungs appear more normal.

Quitters say vaping gives them something to do with their hands -- a big issues
for those trying to quit. Vaping does deliver nicotine, but adherents note it is
without the chemicals and carcinogens found in cigarettes.

While you can pick up basic vaping supplies and equipment at any gas station,
vape shops market atmosphere, assistance and even camaraderie. Jesse Sefcik of
Dickson City is in vaping groups who get together and hang out, have lunch or
play pool, discussing different juices and vaporizers. Sometimes, like a support
group, they share their quitting experience and encourage others.

Vape Lounge

E-cigarettes have been around for a nearly a decade. But the growth is coming
for ""open systems"" which allow people to customize what they smoke, selecting
flavors as diverse as bubblegum and hazelnut.

Unlike the shame they find with cigarettes, vapers find camaraderie and
connoisseurship in the customizable vaping flavors. Many calculate how much
money they have saved since quitting smoking.

""I stopped counting,"" Mr. Sienkiewicz said. ""It made me depressed thinking of
all the money I spent in my smoking years.""

Even though vaping isn't subject to anti-smoking laws, vapers know they will get
the stink eye from customers and staff if they vape up at restaurants. The
lounge gives them a place. Smokers sometimes stop in, thinking they can light up
a cigarette and watch television. They are asked to extinguish or leave. Vape
lounges are almost always non-smoking. The fact that no one in a vape shop
ignites or smokes anything can be difficult for the uninitiated to wrap their
heads around.

Mr. Boice says most customers at the Wilkes-Barre lounge he manages are like him
-- ""recovering addicts"" to cigarettes. Clean and vaping exclusively for about
two years, he has never looked back. He took drags on friends' cigarettes, just
to see how he would react.

""Why would you want to lick an ashtray after you smoke a watermelon?"" he said,
comparing the conventional cigarette to an e-cigarette. ""I'm healthier and happy
and 95 percent of our customers are former or recovering smokers and they are
happy, too, because they got a monkey off their back.""

But it's just another monkey, said the lung association's Mr. Delonti. Research
showed that many vapers are dual users, continuing to smoke while vaping, which
increases their nicotine consumption. He hopes vaping is a fad, like clove
cigarettes and hookah.

But to adherents, it's a lifestyle that's here to stay.

No vaping in public varsities

KANGAR: E-CIGARETTES have been banned in all 20 public universities, according
to a Bernama report.

Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Idris Jusoh said a joint decision on the
matter was reached by all the universities' vice-chancellors (VCs) at a meeting
on Friday.

""Although some of the VCs had made their own announcements to ban vaping on
their campuses, I feel a joint decision is apt because universities are 'green
zones'.

""Before, we only banned the smoking of tobacco, but now, we are extending it to
vaping as well.""

Idris was speaking after opening the Sixth Malaysian Educational Institution
Games at Dewan 2020 here last night. Present were Perlis Menteri Besar Datuk
Seri Azlan Man, Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Mary Yap Kain Ching and
Community College Education Department director-general Datuk Amir Md Noor.

Most students were happy with the decision but they said a specific punishment
was needed for those caught vaping on campus premises.

Muhamad Hisham Hamid, 23, of Universiti Malaysia Perlis said it was about time
that vaping was banned as it was becoming a culture among university students.

""I am seeing more and more people vaping in the campus. Even though some of them
say that e-cigarettes helps them kick the habit of cigarette smoking, it doesn't
mean they should do it on campus.

""We can't take this matter lightly. This is not a healthy culture and the
university should take action against those caught vaping in campus,"" said the
second-year art and design student.

Echoing his sentiment was Sharifah Syakila Syed Shaharuddin, 23, from Universiti
Utara Malaysia.

Syakila said the ministry should have made the announcement earlier as vaping
had become a trend among students and they didn't seem to bother about the
possible side-effects to their health.

""Some students proudly display their vape kit at classrooms and the cafe. The
university should come up with a clear rule and punishment and they must be
reviewed by the ministry,"" said the final-year postgraduate student in applied
linguistics. Universiti Teknologi Mara vice-chancellor Tan Sri Dr Sahol Hamid
Abu Bakar said the university had banned vaping in all its campuses six months
ago.

""For those caught vaping on campus, we will give them two warning letters, and
if they repeat the act, we will fine them RM100.""

Questions remain about use of e-cigarettes to quit smoking

BYLINE: Jacob deNobel, Carroll County Times, Westminster, Md.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

Nov. 19--Each year, the American Cancer Society devotes the third Thursday in
November to the Great American Smokeout, its annual effort to encourage people
to stop smoking, which it says annually costs the United States $96 billion in
tobacco-related health care costs. The ACS recommends a number of options for
quitting smoking from mental to physical tools, with even information on
hypnosis available to those who would like to try.

One method, the ACS does not, of yet, recommend is the use of e-cigarettes, or
vaping, as a smoking cessation tool, citing a lack of studies on the safety of
the devices, the content of the vapor and lack of regulation by organizations
such as the Food and Drug Administration.

For former tobacco user turned e-cigarette salesman Joe Nash, owner of No Limit
Vapors in Westminster, this hesitance is unneeded for a product that he sees as
effective.

Right at the entrance of No Limit is a wall of cigarette packs, which Nash
describes as the final pack wall. Each pack is signed and dated by a customer
symbolizing their abandonment of cigarettes. Nash offers a $5 discount on vaping
starter kits to anyone who brings in their ""last pack.""

Nash gave up chewing tobacco in June 2014, about four months before he opened No
Limit. He said he worries regulation has gone overboard and will drive people
back to tobacco products, which have been proven to be harmful.

In April 2014, the FDA proposed a new rule, extending its authority to regulate
tobacco products to include e-cigarettes. The proposed rule was submitted to the
Office of Management and Budget on Oct. 19 of this year for final review.
According to Michael Felberbaum, spokesperson for the FDA, the organization
received more than 135,000 comments from the public on the proposed rule.

If accepted by the OMB, e-cigarettes would be required to register with the FDA
and report product and ingredient listings, adhere to minimum age and
identification restrictions, include health warning labels and only be marketed
following FDA review, as well as other restrictions.

If accepted, this ruling would allow the FDA to regulate e-cigarettes based on
protecting the public health. As of now, there is no regulatory body for vape
juice and devices. The FDA is currently supporting more than 50 research
projects regarding vaping.

According to Felberbaum, products prior to 2007 will be grandfathered in, and
the ruling will affect newer products only.

Dylan Vogtman, an employee at No Limit, who traded smoking for vaping, said he
is concerned about the effect these regulations will have on smaller businesses
that produce vaping juices and devices independently. He said there have been
extreme advances in vaping technology since 2007, and he fears these will be
priced out of the market.

""There's a man who comes in here and works in a machine shop. He's turned his
skill with machines into making tips for the vape devices. That's his sole
income. A lot of people in the area make their income based on vaping. We have
to step up or else we're going to get pushed out."" Vogtman said. ""Right now,
we're fighting for our right to vape.""

If adopted, the FDA ruling provides variable compliance dates for businesses to
register and submit their product and ingredient lists. For some small
businesses, the FDA will allow for a 24-month grace period where the products
can still be sold prior to registration.

Vogtman said there is a vibrant vaping community that has largely objected to
this proposed regulation. He said there is a petition out to prevent its
application, and earlier this month, e-cigarette users from across the country
called the White House to voice their concerns.

""There's a real vape community. I'd say the friends I've gotten from the vaping
community are better friends than my real friends,"" Vogtman said. ""I live with a
friend of mine who owns a business building vaping devices. I work in a vape
shop and he builds them, so that's 100 percent of our paychecks that come from
vaping.""

Charlie Saunders, of Westminster, said he began vaping this year in order to
stop smoking. He said he began smoking at 19, and now, at 31, wanted to commit
to quitting for his son.

Vape juice comes in a variety of concentrations of nicotine, the addictive
component of cigarettes. Nicotine concentration in the vape juice goes up to 42
milligrams all the way down to none. Saunders began at 24 milligrams per
milliliter of nicotine, but is currently down to just 6.

Despite the presence of nicotine-free vape juice, Nash said many people who come
in having never smoked but wish to begin vaping, begin with 3 milligram juice to
give them the extra nicotine kick. Nash said approximately 90 percent of his
customers are smokers looking to quit or cut down on their tobacco use.

Nash said the range of nicotine allows someone to switch from cigarettes to
vaping and then slowly begin to quit vaping. According to the FDA, there are
questions about the accuracy of nicotine concentrations, which requires further
study.

Nicotine-free vapor is often used in vaping competitions, according to Vogtman,
where e-cigarette users compete to create the largest and most-intricate designs
with their exhaled vapor. Expert vapers have the ability to create vape rings,
designs and even jellyfish with their vapor.

Saunders said vaping has curbed much of his smoking, though he still has a cheat
cigarette or two.

""It's been the best at killing the habits, like smoking in the car. Those places
where you feel like you need a cigarette, now I just vape,"" Saunders said. ""If I
need a moment, I take two quick puffs off the vape and I'm good. You can't
really take two quick drags off of a cigarette. It really helps with that oral
fixation.""

e-cigarettes pose dilemma for hopkins, other cities

BYLINE: SHANNON PRATHER; STAFF WRITER, STAR TRIBUNE (Mpls.-St. Paul)

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1AA

LENGTH: 1154 words","



HIGHLIGHT: Unregulated and increasingly popular, vaping has many city leaders
concerned. Hopkins has decided a moratorium on new retailers is in order.


It's a smoldering issue for many cities - how to handle electronic cigarettes,
the increasingly popular new alternative to conventional smokes.

Specialty shops that sell e-cigarette products and lounges where customers can
sample products are popping up in Twin Cities suburbs. But one western suburban
city council, fearing a stampede of e-cig retailers, has pulled back the reins.

This fall, Hopkins approved a tobacco license for one electronic cigarette
retailer on its Mainstreet, then promptly passed a yearlong moratorium banning
any more until it can better study the issue.

City retailers with tobacco licenses can continue to sell electronic cigarettes,
but are prohibited from on-site sampling. Hopkins' one electronic cigarette
lounge, the Vaping Studio, is allowed to stay open and have on-site sampling
during the moratorium.

The popularity of electronic cigarettes is growing across the country and in
Minnesota. In the past six months alone, five vaping retailers, including a
kiosk at the Northtown Mall, have opened in the north metro city of Blaine.

Electronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine
solution, creating vapor that users inhale. Users absorb nicotine without the
thousands of chemicals, tar or odor of conventional cigarettes.

E-cigs and the chemical mixtures used in them are largely unregulated by federal
and state law, so cities have little guidance on how to manage these new
businesses.

That's why Hopkins city leaders decided to put the brakes on more vaping rooms.
City leaders, who banned hookah lounges just a year ago, want to learn more
about vaping and the products used in the process. Hopkins City Manager Mike
Mornson said the council hopes state and federal authorities will step in soon
and set some regulations on vaping.

""What is in these e-cigarettes?"" he asked. ""There's just some education that
needs to be done. We don't want to have a run on tobacco licenses. There were
also some concerns [that] youth are getting into vaping.""

Mornson said city leaders are wondering about the best locations for these

types of businesses. The one vaping room in town is in a basement space on
Hopkins' historic Mainstreet.

""If these are going to be allowed, where is the best place for them to be
allowed? It created a little bit of concern if these should be situated
throughout our Mainstreet area,"" Mornson said. ""I think you are going to see a
lot of these issues front and center in a lot of communities. They are exploding
as far as sales.""

Hopkins Council Member Jason Gadd said the moratorium is not a judgment on
vaping, but purely about safety.

""It is a new area,"" he said. ""There is no regulation on it. We want to make sure
our residents are protected. That's why we are giving the staff some time to
take a look at it. I am sure there will be state and federal regulations coming
out.""

Bars, theaters see more use

E-cigs don't smell or create smoke like conventional cigarettes, and users can
control the amount of nicotine involved. Proponents of vaping say it's cleaner,
safer and less intrusive than conventional smoking.

Still, some are questioning their use in public. Local bars and restaurants are
starting to see more use. Gadd, a nonsmoker, said he's seen someone vaping in a
local movie theater, says he's not sure yet how he feels about that.

Electronic cigarettes are not restricted under the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air
Act, so businesses and some cities, including Duluth, are adopting their own
rules.

In Anoka County, the Blaine City Council has approved five tobacco licenses for
e-cigarette rooms. But during recent tobacco compliance checks involving a minor
who was working with police, 13 of the city's 54 licensed tobacco retailers,
including two electronic cigarette retailers, failed.

'It's here to stay'

Paula Williams, who owns the Vaping Studio at 811 Mainstreet in Hopkins, has
been open for business for six weeks.

Williams, the controller at the Dakota Jazz Club in Minneapolis, decided to go
into the vaping business after seeing a number of vaping shops in Florida during
a March trip.

""They had a vaping shop on every corner. It was like Walgreens,"" she said.
""People call it a fad. I think it's here to stay.""

Williams, 50, who has owned several businesses, including the Delightful Biteful
catering company, began researching the vaping industry and writing a business
plan.

She mixes the liquids that she sells to her clients on site in a kitchen, using
gloves and other cleanliness standards she learned in the catering industry. She
said her mixtures include food-grade propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and
nicotine, bought from a North Carolina chemical company, if customers want it.
Most do, she says, but a few smoke without it.

Williams said her store asks anyone who looks under 25 for an ID.

Customers can buy liquids in 35 flavors, ranging from black honey tobacco to
banana bread and Smurffette, which is a mixture of wild blueberry and French
vanilla. Customers often come in for a tasting experience.

Vaping is less expensive than smoking, Williams said. A starter vaping device
and liquid costs around $30. Liquid refills are around $7 each and are the
equivalent of around five packs of cigarettes. More elaborate vaping devices
cost upward of $100.

Williams, a 30-year smoker, said she lights up conventional cigarettes much less
now that she vapes.

Molly McIntosh, Williams' store manager, said she's smoking less too now that
she vapes. Her hair no longer reeks of cigarette smoke and her smoker's cough
has gone away, she said.

""I have people pass me on the street and say, 'Oh, your perfume smells so good,'
said McIntosh, 18. It's actually the smell from her flavored vaping. ""I used to
have a smoker's cough. I am too young for a smoker's cough.""

'It's the Wild West'

The American Lung Association has taken a position against electronic
cigarettes, saying they are not proven smoking-cessation devices.

""Our position is we feel these devices are really not well understood and we
know they are not well regulated,"" said Robert Moffitt, spokesman for the
American Lung Association in Minnesota. ""We are advocating the FDA to step up.
Right now, it's in limbo. It's the Wild West in terms of retail shops opening
up, the type of information going out and the claims being made.

""We would urge caution for anyone thinking about trying them or any community
that would allow a proliferation of these shops to open up,"" he said.

Moffitt said the fact that chemicals are mixed in shop backrooms should give
consumers pause and that the proliferation of fruity flavors can entice children
and teens. He also pointed to the growth in television ads for vaping products,
which conventional cigarette companies are forbidden from running.

""We have not seen a tobacco commercial on the air in 40 years,"" he said. ""They
are taking advantage of this utter lack of regulation to do what they will.""

How vapers can help smokers quit

LENGTH: 1440 words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Enterprise Institute has issued the following news
release:A



 The controversy surrounding electronic cigarettes continues to smolder.
E-cigarettes are the battery-powered devices that deliver an aerosol that
contains nicotine but no trace of cancer-causing tar. Despite ample data to the
contrary, critics insist that e-cigarettes are a &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; to teen
smoking and that they contain dangerous levels of toxins. Meanwhile, the Food
and Drug Administration has yet to issue regulations.





 Things may seem stagnant &ndash; the same debates, the same anxieties about
pending regulatory over-reach &ndash; yet researchers are busy. And new data
from Scotland underscore how e-cigarettes are helping smokers quit, saving
millions of lives and untold health care dollars. More exciting, it suggests an
untapped way to spread e-cigarette use, or vaping, to smokers who might
otherwise not try to give up their deadly habit or who have failed using
traditional means.



 In a new survey, psychologist Christopher Russell and colleagues at the Centre
for Drug Misuse in Glasgow collected a large pool of data from vapers. The
Centre, an independent research entity that collects epidemiological data on
substance abuse and harm reduction efforts, and performs policy evaluations, has
received research funding from public bodies, such as the UK Government
Department of Health and the United Nations, and from tobacco companies, such as
British American Tobacco and Philip Morris.



 The study is important because it relies on a large survey of people who have
ever vaped. Russell ran an online poll, conducted over 12 weeks last summer, of
7,300 people who said they had vaped at least once. Of those, 5,000 had been
regular smokers when they first tried vaping. Russell&rsquo;s data show
overwhelmingly that vaping helps smokers quit. More than 80% of smokers had quit
completely since they started vaping regularly, which, at the time of the
survey, was an average of 14 months before they took the survey.



 Of the respondents who were still smoking at the time of the survey, more than
56%, had at least halved their daily smoking since starting regular vaping
(defined as at least every other day). The average reduction was from 23
cigarettes per day pre-vaping to 4 per day.



 To round out the picture of the experiences and motives of vapers, Russell
asked a litany of questions: What was their experience with flavors and nicotine
strengths; their reasons for vaping; their perceptions of harm relative to
cigarettes, their perception of addictiveness of e-cigarettes relative to
cigarettes, health changes they have personally experienced since initiating
vaping? Then came the question with real public health power: &ldquo;What could
smokers, who are curious about using e-cigarettes to quit smoking, learn from
vapers who have quit or significantly reduced their smoking by using
e-cigarettes?&rdquo;



 The most common piece of advice that these successful vapers had to offer
concerned the importance of finding the right device and flavor for the user.
Other advice included &ldquo;don&rsquo;t start with a cig-a-like [the weaker
versions that look like cigarettes]. Rather, start with a newer generation
device,&rdquo; &ldquo;ask for expert advice,&rdquo; &ldquo;do not expect a
cigarette experience.&rdquo;



 Here&rsquo;s where Russell&rsquo;s survey spurs an idea that could start saving
lives tomorrow: why not assemble a loose network of potential vaping sponsors?
True, some vapers communicate informally with smokers already, but if we can
build a vaper-smoker buddy system into the public health landscape, we can
further arm the fight against smoking.



 The local health department or area hospitals could run public service ads on
TV or radio and post billboards advertising the availability of vaping buddies
(or sponsors, navigators, etc). A website would contain the name of local vapers
who volunteer to serve as sponsors or direct smokers to local vape shops where
those names would be listed, too.



 Civic-minded vapers could sign up to be sponsors through the local vape shop or
health department. Their names could be posted at the nurses&rsquo; station of
emergency rooms and circulated to local primary care doctors who can urge their
smoking patients with COPD and other smoking-related conditions to pair up with
someone on the list.



 It need not be a long-term relationship, but it would be a great way to
introduce a patient to vaping if his or her physician determines that the
patient intends to keep smoking for the foreseeable future or has had little to
no success in quitting with the help of conventional anti-smoking aids.



 People grappling with alcohol and drug problems routinely have sponsors as part
of their involvement with Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. Although
most smokers don&rsquo;t need long-term support groups, they need awareness of
alternatives, access to them, accurate information, and encouragement.



 After all, a vaping sponsor can provide the same benefits that have helped so
many others quit alcohol. As Stanford University psychologist Keith Humphreys, a
scholar of addiction recovery self-help groups, notes, &ldquo;a large number of
studies identify &lsquo;active ingredients&rsquo; of AA&rsquo;s effect, as role
models for change, greater social support, better coping skills, greater
self-confidence, and more motivation to change.&rdquo;



 Unlike many abusers of intoxicants, nicotine-dependent people don&rsquo;t need
to learn to live without a drug, they need to learn to use it in a safer form.
They need practical advice (best local vape shop, how to maintain equipment, how
to find high quality e-liquid); they need to know what they can expect (e.g.
that dual use &ndash; vaping while continuing to smoke, at the beginning is very
common) and which puff techniques lead to maximal satisfaction. They need a fair
assessment of the known and unknown risks associated with alternatives to
cigarettes and some need general motivational support if they are ambivalent
about relinquishing cigarettes.



 The day to day policy implications of these observations in combination with
known facts about behavioral change argue for a number of strategies.



 Take public vaping. Vaping has already been banned from offices, public parks,
restaurants and airports. But at the very least, it should be allowed in
non-smoking adult establishments with well-marked vaping areas. While not
emission-free, any &ldquo;second-hand&rdquo; vapor that wafts several feet,
unlike smoke from a cigarette, will be virtually undetectable as the subtly
&ldquo;flavored&rdquo; odors dissipate rapidly. Studies show that emissions,
such as propylene glycol, formaldehyde, and acrolein, are at negligible levels,
thus below clinically meaningful thresholds for otherwise healthy bystanders.



 The idea is for people who smoke to be exposed to vapers as often and as
visibly as possible. The infiltration of vapers into non-smoking environments
where there are temporarily abstaining smokers (that is, smokers who are, at the
moment, banned from lighting up) is a great way to spur curiosity and
conversation about vaping.



 For non-smokers, the difference between vaping and smoking should be reinforced
in every way possible. And that difference should make vaping look more
attractive than smoking. For example, airports should have attractive vaping
lounges. Smokers will still have to go outside.



 There is a large literature on what people need to do to change a
well-established habit. If we want people to stop smoking, we&rsquo;re likely to
engage them more successfully if there is a feasible replacement available. In
the case of smoking, it&rsquo;s vaping. Not only that, the smoker needs a sense
of &ldquo;self-efficacy,&rdquo; the confidence that he or she can engage in the
replacement activity and be successful at it. Showing someone how it&rsquo;s
done, answering questions, reducing uncertainty is an excellent way to do that.



 I&rsquo;m excited to see how Christopher Russell turns established vapers into
assets: what strategies does he use and how successful is he. I&rsquo;m
optimistic. The &ldquo;vaping sponsor&rdquo; &ndash; my term &ndash; aspect of
his project will start in December. As he says, &ldquo;To dismiss, misuse or
under-use these individuals&rsquo; insights and experiences as part of health
services&rsquo; efforts to engage with smokers would, in my opinion, be a
monumental missed public health opportunity.&rdquo;

Is vaping cure for smoking?

SECTION: Viewpoint; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 509 words","


IT is a fact that smoking can kill. But people continue to smoke anyway, even
with the gory pictures on cigarette boxes. Prices of cigarettes have gone up
many times in the last decade, but it is not an effective way to keep people
from lighting up. Even rigorous campaigns against contraband cigarettes, which
are said to be more dangerous than legal ones, cannot stop smugglers from
bringing in stock. But a few years back, e-cigarettes came into the picture,
supposedly to ""cure"" those addicted to conventional cigarettes. The trend became
more popular at the beginning of this year, and now, it has become a norm to
see, on social media, youngsters inhaling vapour.

Users claim that they get more energy after vaping, although there is no
scientific evidence that it is an energy booster, and more and more people are
attracted to it. Is this the ultimate cure for smoking addiction? It seems like
it is, but there are many reports that say vaping is as dangerous as smoking, if
not worse. Now, the government wants to prohibit vaping in non-smoking zones as
people are seen vaping everywhere - in restaurants, offices and other public
places, where smoking is prohibited. Of late, we have seen pictures of pupils
getting caught in school for vaping. And, disciplinary teachers are frequently
checking for vaping paraphernalia in schoolbags, as students might sneak into
the toilets for a quick puff. Women are also attracted to vaping and the growing
number is a cause for concern. Describing the trend as dangerous, Deputy Health
Minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahaya quoted an international study that says
propylene glycol, a chemical additive used to produce vapour, is proven to turn
into formaldehyde. ""The substance was found to be carcinogenic or can cause
cancer,"" he said, adding that the ministry would conduct a study to get a
clearer picture and review the findings soon. Dr Dalilah Kamaruddin, chief
medical officer of the National Cancer Society, Cancer Screening Centre, said
liquid nicotine inhaled from an e-cigarette had the same properties as nitric
acid, a known chemical catalyst in the occurrence of cancer in the body.

However, Malaysian Medical Association president Dr Ashok Zachariah Philip said
while he was not aware of any studies that had been published or were about to
be published about the dangers of e-cigarettes in Malaysia, the association
would like to see the authorities err on the side of caution. He said the
ministry was trying to restrict vaping because of the strong likelihood that
drawing chemical vapour into the lungs for years would cause damage. Perhaps,
Muslim Consumers Association of Malaysia chief activist Datuk Nadzim Johan's
suggestion to the ministry that it conducts research or refers to findings from
those with experience, instead of someone with a vested interest in the issue,
should be looked at. Since vaping is a relatively new craze among the young,
there is no record that shows it can cause damage to users. The side effects, if
any, would be known only 10 or 20 years from now.

to find high quality e-liquid); they need to know what they can expect (e.g.
that dual use &ndash; vaping while continuing to smoke, at the beginning is very
common) and which puff techniques lead to maximal satisfaction. They need a fair
assessment of the known and unknown risks associated with alternatives to
cigarettes and some need general motivational support if they are ambivalent
about relinquishing cigarettes.
 The day to day policy implications of these observations in combination with
known facts about behavioral change argue for a number of strategies.
 Take public vaping. Vaping has already been banned from offices, public parks,
restaurants and airports. But at the very least, it should be allowed in
non-smoking adult establishments with well-marked vaping areas. While not
emission-free, any &ldquo;second-hand&rdquo; vapor that wafts several feet,
unlike smoke from a cigarette, will be virtually undetectable as the subtly
&ldquo;flavored&rdquo; odors dissipate rapidly. Studies show that emissions,
such as propylene glycol, formaldehyde, and acrolein, are at negligible levels,
thus below clinically meaningful thresholds for otherwise healthy bystanders.
 The idea is for people who smoke to be exposed to vapers as often and as
visibly as possible. The infiltration of vapers into non-smoking environments
where there are temporarily abstaining smokers (that is, smokers who are, at the
moment, banned from lighting up) is a great way to spur curiosity and
conversation about vaping.
 For non-smokers, the difference between vaping and smoking should be reinforced
in every way possible. And that difference should make vaping look more
attractive than smoking. For example, airports should have attractive vaping
lounges. Smokers will still have to go outside.
 There is a large literature on what people need to do to change a
well-established habit. If we want people to stop smoking, we&rsquo;re likely to
engage them more successfully if there is a feasible replacement available. In
the case of smoking, it&rsquo;s vaping. Not only that, the smoker needs a sense
of &ldquo;self-efficacy,&rdquo; the confidence that he or she can engage in the
replacement activity and be successful at it. Showing someone how it&rsquo;s
done, answering questions, reducing uncertainty is an excellent way to do that.
 I&rsquo;m excited to see how Christopher Russell turns established vapers into
assets: what strategies does he use and how successful is he. I&rsquo;m
optimistic. The &ldquo;vaping sponsor&rdquo; &ndash; my term &ndash; aspect of
his project will start in December. As he says, &ldquo;To dismiss, misuse or
under-use these individuals&rsquo; insights and experiences as part of health
services&rsquo; efforts to engage with smokers would, in my opinion, be a
monumental missed public health opportunity.&rdquo;

Malacca may ban vaping by Muslims

BYLINE: Kelly Koh

SECTION: Pg. 24

LENGTH: 183 words","


MALACCA: THE Malacca Islamic Religious Department (Jaim) is considering issuing
an edict to ban vaping among Muslims in the state.

Its director Datuk Salleh Ismail said the decision would be announced after the
council met with the state Health Department officials.

""We have yet to declare vaping as 'haram' and we will conclude sometime next
month. There are still issues pertaining to vaping that must be discussed with
the Health Department before any decision is made,"" he said.

Earlier, Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar banned vaping in Johor
and ordered the ban to be enforced in a month's time. Sultan Ibrahim instructed
all vaping outlets to close down by Jan 1 next year.

The Kedah government also decided to ban vaping and shisha smoking by Muslims
during the Kedah Fatwa committee meeting held on Nov 23.

Kedah Mufti Datuk Syeikh Muhamad Baderudin Ahmad said the ban was made after a
careful study of facts, especially from the medical point of view and based on
the Quran.

""It would have detrimental effects, especially on future generations, not just
Muslims,"" he said.

How many hats in Harpenden?

SIR - Harpenden town councillors must be a great boon to the hat industry. As
you point out in your Editor's Comment of February 11, the current Harpenden
Mayor Brian Ellis holds the cabinet portfolio for housing, while coincidentally
backing a Harpenden housing development that will cause the demise of one of the
town's last colonies of red-listed Helix Pomatia.â ¨Conflict of interest, you
suggested? It seems not.â ¨I am at a loss to understand why the tiny enclosed
green space at Westfield, home to so much LEGALLY PROTECTED wildlife should be
the focus of thousands and thousand of pounds of rate-payers money being wasted
on spurious planning ventures, plus a three day public enquiry to prevent my
Town Green Application from going forward. Surely to goodness it can't be some
spiteful vendetta being enacted against those of us who live locally and have
been *foolish* enough to object to having our lives blighted by excess
development?â ¨I wonder what hats our councillors will be donning in the months
leading up to May's local elections.... perhaps straw ones might be the most
apposite.



CAROL HEDGESâ ¨Coldharbour Lane, Harpendenâ ¨

Vision for vaping

SIR - 2016 has heralded two joys in our fine city. The first is the apparent
closure of one of the 99p shops at the end of St Peter's Street - joyous news in
itself for those at least with taste, more than a little consumer savvy and real
bargain appreciation. The second is the upsurge in vaping shops. For the
uninitiated, vaping is a 95% less harmful form of smoking; the ""vaper"" inhaling
a fruity blend of two harmless (everyday agents) with or without nicotine which,
when heated, is exhaled as an equally harmless vapour. The great beauty of
vaping is (for those who appreciate smoking sheesha or indeed cigarettes), aside
from the obvious health benefits, that the streets are far cleaner for vapers'
presence. There are no discarded butts, no gangs of shop workers poisoning the
air as you walk past them standing outside their respective workplaces drawing
on the noxious cocktail of 3,000 (mostly carcinogenic) chemicals contained in a
cigarette and no empty fag packets clogging up bins, ashtrays and gutterways.
Indeed, I tip my hat to vapers for the ingenuity and eco-consciousness of their
newfound habit; vaping also being infinitely more pleasurable than smoking.
Vaping is not illegal (yet), the exhaled ""cloud"" of deliciousness dissipates
instantly leaving a perfumed odour of either strawberries, custard or biscuits,
whatever flavour the vaper is vaping - and each bottle of e-juice (the
concentrate which the vaper vapes costs a lot more than 99p!!! So, to all you
vaping retailers out there, we have one thankfully soon to be empty retail unit
available which would make an ideal vaping store. A place where ex-smokers,
lovers of fruit salad inhalation and Sheesha pipes can buy their sticks, mods,
coils and drip tips - and where you won't find a cheap jar of flavourless
Slovakian chillies or a poor value packet of Russian Weetabix anywhere. I thank
you!

Hopeful about new day centre scheme

SIR - With reference to the proposed new day centre and the interesting letter
by Debbie Fensome (February 4) concerning the Pegasus plans.â ¨Last year I wrote
to you and you printed my letter telling your readers how we, the remaining
members of the James Marshall Day Centre, had to leave there on December 16,
2014, as the buildings were to be demolished. Thanks to our councillor Rosemary
Farmer, we moved to the Lea Springs Residence and continued to enjoy our Tuesday
activities. And how happy we have been there! Lovely warm surroundings, comfy
large chairs, excellent lunches in the restaurant. The residents join us for the
bingo session and later we play cards.â ¨Although our numbers have dwindled
somewhat, due to the age, the rest of us 'soldier on' looking forward to our
return to Leyton Road.â ¨Now it all seems 'doom and gloom' according to Debbie's
assessment of the plans. I hope not.â ¨Once we move back to Leyton Road, we hope
to resume daily meetings and increased membership.â ¨I feel sure this will
happen. Let us wait and see when the new building is complete.

Why we need Trident option

SIR - I refer to the letter from St Albans Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
(February 11). â ¨Ukraine is the only country that has voluntarily given up its
own viable nuclear arsenal. It had the world's third largest number of nuclear
weapons.â ¨On December 5 1994 in Budapest there was an agreement signed by
Ukraine, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States that in recognition of
giving up all its nuclear weapons the four countries would guarantee the
security of Ukraine's borders and independence. We now know what the result of
that has been!â ¨Last year, at the height of Russia's intervention in the
Ukraine, Russia reminded the west that it is a major nuclear power. Russia has
also announced that it is increasing and improving its nuclear capability.â ¨The
letter from St Albans Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament suggests that as NATO
provides a nuclear umbrella the UK doesn't need to have the weapons itself. This
is the height of hypocrisy. It is equivalent to saying that Hertfordshire does
not need to provide a fire service because if we ever had a fire someone else
would come and save us and this would save us spending money!

KEN SHUTTLEWORTHâ ¨Reynards Way, St Albans

SIR - Laurie Gibson of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament should not be
allowed to get away with the misinformation masquerading as ""reasons"" for
opposing renewal of Trident (February 11).â ¨He repeats the lie propagated again
and again that Trident will cost ""the enormous sum of £100 billion"". The real,
budgeted expenditure will be £25 billion over its 50-year life, which is £500
million a year to protect our country against any future nuclear threat, a price
well worth paying when the safety and security of our people should and must be
the No 1 priority of every government. Unless, of course, it is led by that
lifelong disarmer and peace-at-any-price campaigner Jeremy Corbyn.â ¨Mr Gibson
trots out CND's latest bombshell ""reason"" why Trident won't work: underwater
drones will soon be patrolling the oceans to detect nuclear submarines. Labour
MPs were incredulous last week when Emily Thornberry, the shadow defence
minister, spouted this absurdity, prompting Lord West, the former Navy chief who
served in the  Labour government, to describe her revelation as ""nonsense"".
Doubtless this MP with absolutely no experience of military matters knows better
than one of our most courageous naval leaders who spent a lifetime in the Navy.
Remember, though, that Ms Thornberry learnt about these underwater drones from
""young Turks"", whoever they may be. Tell us who they are, Emily.â ¨Then again,
when Mr Corbyn has suggested our new Trident submarines could go to sea without
nuclear missiles, we all have to acknowledge the Cloud Cuckoo Land in which the
latest New Labour now resides. What's next, Jeremy, our soldiers to have guns
but no bullets? Our fighter jets to have engines but no armaments? Tanks without
shells? You could go on and on.â ¨Mr Gibson tries to argue that Trident is
ineffective against ""the real threats to our security"", such as terrorism and
the so-called Islamic State. Some of us who know the history of our country
recall how in the thirties peace campaigners fought against expenditure on our
Armed Forces, assuring us that Hitler was no danger to Europe's peace. We all
know what happened next in 1939. Now CND is expecting us to gamble that there
will be no nuclear threat to the United Kingdom in 2019, 2029, 2039, 2049. Those
are the sort of time frames the Government has to prepare for. â ¨Yet we only
have to look at the reckless and dangerous military adventurism of Vladimir
Putin to realise the kind of dangers we face at this very moment.â ¨When Ukraine
became independent, it decided on a policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament,
returning its weapons to Russia. We should all know what happened next. Putin
invaded and annexed huge areas of Ukraine. That was a warning to us all,
absolute confirmation that we need our nuclear weapons, we need to renew
Trident.â ¨So let CND have their demonstrations. We hope they appreciate how
blessed they are to live in a country where democracy allows such freedoms. But
the rest of us must never forget that our enemies, and especially Putin's
Russia, will be applauding their protests and praying for the end of our nuclear
shield.

What does future hold for village?

SIR - It is now more than 20 years since London Colney Village Concern produced
the original cassette version of the state of our community in 1995 (later
issued as a DVD 'The Village Video') illustrating how we were at that time. We
were already moving away from many familiar scenes of yesteryear and recording
several changes and challenges to our former way of life. The Local History
Society summarised numerous aspects of life over earlier decades and there were
articles by David Ansell about the High Street shops in the '50s. If that time
is compared to the situation today, using our DVD as a yardstick, one finally
notices the difference now So, what has happened to us?â ¨Perhaps it is  the
recent pressures from motor traffic along main roads, with the pull of Colney
Fields Retail Park and its HGV suppliers, and more commuters pushing through our
village to avoid major roundabouts queues at each end of our bypass? Remember
the jams on Barnet Road which were predicted and the fight to open a new access
to the Riverside Estate? Our film covered the last months of the hospital at
Napsbury which is now a huge housing development but it was the end of local
employment there just as other work dried up in nearby factories. We were losing
on every front, as the police station vanished as 'an economy measure' to add
extra homes (and cars) to our crowded roads and kerbsides. Now there are streams
of vehicles weaving between parked cars, pedestrians and cyclists with scant
regard for narrow pathways or any speed limits. So much for a reasonable quality
of life in this 'lovely village' when you look back over those precious years!
Is it still a place you like?â ¨Well, it could get much worse. There are plans
to stuff every gap with more houses if there is little resistance to the idea
but no real way of improving a feeble infrastructure to cope with further
pressures on vital public utilities. The latest SLP [Strategic Local Plan] for
the St Albans area needs careful study and sensible comment early in 2016
because it will affect us in various ways and we need to  know who we can trust
to make decisions on our behalf. While we are alarmed by reports on 'Earth's
Global Warming' we do not seem to notice that our own neighbourhood is now such
a mess: yet we could Do Something Useful about that! The reason for our lack of
effort stems from futile attempts to solve problems properly at various levels
of local government cursed by political expediency or by devious buck-passing
moves to escape responsibility or any blame for mistakes â ¨Village Concern is
alert to this situation and has offered valid facts and advice to local
councillors for many years. Support has been sought and found with the
Taxpayer's Alliance (TPA, based in Westminster, SW1) who are powerful allies
when needed and there are links with 'The Flood Forum' at national level and to
European experts on IT/Transportation. We now need people who care about the
future right here to join us as we try to improve this village by identifying
what has to be done, and just how we can make it happen soon - before it is
really too late

Blind to reality of climate change

SIR - The answer to Mr Keech's  ""How much global warming is due to manmade CO2?""
(February 11) is we don't know.  But we do know the total amount in the
atmosphere has been rising steadily over recent years (as from burning fossil
fuels, not sporadically as from volcanoes) and as I noted before, its inherent
properties mean it hinders night-time cooling.â ¨Similarly we don't know if
global temperatures will creep upwards in future, though 2015 has now been
announced as the warmest year globally on the 150-year instrumental record. But
it would surely be sensible to prepare for the possibility by reducing our
dependence on fossil fuels (including fracking!) by diversifying into
renewables. If the climate sceptics are right, well at least we'll have taken
those important steps towards energy security and self-sufficiency.  If they're
wrong,  we'll have wasted years doing nothing and finding the climatic and
energy problems that much more intractable.â ¨As to the 'billions' Mr Keech says
we're spending on climate research: I imagine the department concerned
(www.BIS.gov.uk) would give a more accurate, and much lower, figure.

JOHN DAVISâ ¨Fairmead Avenue, Harpendenâ ¨

SIR - I want to reply to the letter from Chris Keech in last week's Herts
Advertiser because I fear that his repetition of the outdated mantras of climate
change denial might still influence some of your readers.â ¨Mr Keech insists on
re-asserting this old myth that the world's temperature has not risen
significantly since 1997. He fails to take into account the evidence of 2015
which was by far the warmest year ever (leaving 1997 way behind) and the common
consensus of experts that 2016 will be even warmer. Of course there is an
intense El Nino now but the 1997-1998 El Nino was bigger still.â ¨Allowing for
the effects of El Nino/La Nina, the rise in global temperature over the last 20
years is close to the expected value consistent with the measured rise in carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. Global warming is still progressing as predicted, as
inevitably it must do if atmospheric carbon dioxide continues to go up.â ¨There
is no doubt that the rise in carbon dioxide is due to the burning of fossil
fuels because it is fairly easy to measure the amount of coal and oil etc which
is burnt each year and thus to calculate how much carbon dioxide goes into the
atmosphere annually. The amount calculated from fuel burning is consistent with
what is measured in the atmosphere (given that about half of the carbon dioxide
added to the atmosphere is taken up by sea water).If the increase in carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is not due to humans burning fossil fuels, then where
else does Mr Keech think these extra gigatons of carbon dioxide come from?â ¨No
doubt Mr Keech is exaggerating when he suggests that billions of pounds are
going into climate research but even if it were true it would still be a bargain
if it stops the world from careering along the primrose way to the everlasting
bonfire of climate disaster.â ¨I prefer to believe the professional scientists
who study these problems and fortunately, most governments worldwide take the
same view so there are some recent indications that nations will agree to
restrict global warming to two degrees over pre-industrial levels by cutting
fossil fuel burning. Two degrees is not good but probably the best we can hope
for.

DAVID ALLANâ ¨The Dell, St Albansâ ¨â ¨Rail freight site will affect homes quota


SIR - All but a tiny minority of your readers will hope that local MPs Anne Main
and Oliver Dowden succeed in blocking the Helioslough freight depot development
at Park Street (Herts Advertiser, February 11).â ¨If that 119-hectare tract of
Green Belt has nevertheless to be sacrificed - which appears to be inevitable -
let it be used to greater social benefit, namely for housing, as the MPs
suggest.â ¨Until the destiny of the Park Street site has been determined, St
Albans district council's Strategic Local Plan (SLP) relating to housing
provision between now and 2031, should therefore not be submitted for
'examination' - as defined in SLP documentation - by government inspectors.â ¨Of
crucial relevance, the council is required by central government to sanction the
building of 8720 new homes, over the 20 year period 2011 to 2031, an average of
436 per annum. That 'quota', as currently projected in the SLP, cannot be
fulfilled without removing Green Belt protection from areas of countryside far
more attractively rural than the former Handley Page airfield site.â ¨I refer in
particular to the site designated 'S5' in the SLP, to the north of Harpenden,
where up to 500 dwellings are planned, and smaller parcels of Green Belt land in
Harpenden close to Roundwood Park schools.â ¨It is not clear how many homes
could be built on the airfield site at Park Street, but it would clearly run
into hundreds.â ¨If development was given the go-ahead, that number could
obviously be 'deducted' from the quantity of homes required to be built
elsewhere in the district. The number of homes likely to be erected on the site
in London Road, St Albans, originally destined for a Tesco superstore, should
also be deducted from that total.â ¨Those two potential, and substantial, new
housing sites, at Park Street and London Road, which were not envisaged when the
SLP was being drafted, would greatly diminish the need to build on Green Belt
land elsewhere in the district, especially bearing in mind that an independent
report commissioned by the district council, recommended Green Belt housing
development ""only under exceptional circumstances"".

Misguided over busway proposal

SIR - Howard Green's letter of last week is interesting in its history of the
old Knapsbury link between the Abbey line and the Thameslink. The restoration of
any such links would undoubtedly be useful, if only as a diversionary route at
times of disruption.â ¨However, it is a pity that he raises once again the idea
of the guided busway. This has been well-aired and discussed, in this paper and
elsewhere.â ¨I would refer him, and everyone else, to Nick Dibben's excellent
article in RailFuture: www.railfuture.org.uk/article1545-Paving-over-tracks.
Suffice it to say that as a result of ABFLY's well-informed lobbying, with
overwhelming public support, this idea is no longer being considered by the
powers-that-be, who are instead concentrating on the long-awaited improvement of
the rail service.â ¨With the West Coast rail franchise - including the Abbey
line - currently up for renewal, now is the time for all users, actual and
potential, to support our campaign by going to

Sludge solutions

SIR - In last week's letter describing the time 50 years ago when people bathed
in Verulamium Lake, my friend Peter Wares ended on a euphoric note which
unfortunately was all fanciful thinking.â ¨To start with, there is no healthy
flow of water through the lake, he mistook a bypass pipe for the real ones.  The
trickle which does flow into the top boating lake via a half-opened sluice is
the same as it has been for several years and can be judged by flow over the
weir at the footbridge.â ¨The rubbish and sludge which has ""disappeared"" has in
fact sunk down to join the existing layer which now leaves a depth of about
200mms of clearish water.  So sludge depth is now about a metre deep even in the
middle of the lake where dipping coots hardly have to reach down to get edible
shoots to eat.â ¨So quite definitely the lake has  not reached the point where
the health will be restored, this will only happen if the sludge is removed  and
a good depth of water achieved.â ¨As I keep pointing out the obvious route is to
employ a floating dredger with a rotary sludge collecting head pumping the
liquid sludge to receiver tubes ranged on the banks of the lake to allow the
clear water to seep back into the lake.â ¨After allowing the silt to dry out it
could then be transported by lorry to the Cottonmill Lane allotments where it
could be dumped to raise the level of the allotments which are annually
subjected to flooding. Of course a nuetralising period would be required before
the plots were re-allocated.â ¨If this was somewhere like Saudi Arabia the
pumping tubes could be laid from the park to the allotment site,  distance being
no object when booster pumps are used, but there are too many obstacles in the
way.

Board of health set to consider regulations on e-cigarettes, vaping

BYLINE: Greg Jordan, Bluefield Daily Telegraph, W.Va.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 679 words","


May 10--PRINCETON -- Should vaping, the use of electronic nicotine devices, fall
under the same indoor air regulations as smoking cigarettes? It's a question
being considered May 13 before the Mercer County Board of Health.

The board of health is currently seeking public comment about whether
e-cigarettes, which generate flavored vapor to deliver nicotine to their users,
should be included in the county's clean indoor air regulations. Proponents of
the devices said at previous board meetings said they should be regulated to
some extent, but they fear a ban on them.

Tony Colosi, co-owner of The Sly Foxx in Princeton, said he didn't want children
to use the vaping devices, and that West Virginia already has a regulation
prohibiting sales to people less than 18 years old. The Federal Food and Drug
Administration is currently working to determine how the devices should be
regulated.

The liquid used in vaping devices contains nicotine, flavoring, vegetable
propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin, he said. Except for the nicotine and
flavoring, the substances are same used for breathing treatments.

Colosi said the devices should not be used in public places such as schools,
jails or government buildings. Whether they can be used in businesses should be
up to business owners, he added. Bars, restaurants, and clubs that offer smoking
sections could also offer vaping sections.

The vegetable products and flavoring used in e-cigarettes are found in grocery
stores, but that does not mean they are meant to be used for vaping, Jennifer
Farmer, director of the Southern Coalfields Tobacco Prevention Network, said.
Chemicals used for baking are not necessarily meant to be inhaled.

""When you do that (FDA) testing, you want to make sure it's going to be safe for
the consumer, for the general consumer as a whole,"" said Greg Puckett of
Community Connections. ""Unfortunately, the FDA has not ruled still on that. It
makes it very difficult to show that it's harmful.""

One concern is the liquid nicotine used in the devices; to say it is harmless is
""blatantly false,"" Puckett said. There have been fears that children could
sample the nicotine. Puckett and Farmer both stated that nicotine has been used
to make insecticide.

In humans, a fatal dose of nicotine is as little as 50 to 60 milligrams, Farmer
said. Nicotine is used for its addictive qualities, and manufacturers have used
other chemicals to make cigarettes even more addictive, Puckett said.

""Cigarettes have been around a long time, and they've changed a lot from what
they were 50 years ago,"" Puckett said. ""What we have today isn't even the same.
The additives and chemicals preservatives make them more addictive so they
(manufacturers) have a continual customer base.""

Chemical compounds including cadmium and formaldehyde coming from the devices'
batteries could become part of the vapor when they are heated, Puckett said.

""It breaks them down into an aerosol form that gets back over into the device.
That's my understanding,"" he said. ""They're saying it's a cessation type device,
where if you don't want to smoke that this is less harmful, but harm is harm. It
doesn't matter how you look at that, and so why do you do want to ingest
something that's actually doing physical, permanent harm?""

Each of West Virginia's 55 counties has smoke free workplace and public place
regulations, and 26 have regulations including e-cigarettes, Farmer said.

Susan Kadar, administrator for the Mercer County Health Department, said she
would give the board members an update May 13 on the proposal to add
e-cigarettes to the county's clean indoor air regulations.

No decision will be made at that meeting, and members of the public can still
submit comments, she said. Comments can be submitted by emailing them to
Susan.P.Kadar@wv.gov People can also comment by visiting or calling the Mercer
County Health Department facility in Green Valley.

Licensing is key, says vaping association

SECTION: Pg. 5

LENGTH: 486 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: The government may have dropped the plan to ban e-cigarettes, but
licensing remains the key to effective regulation.

The move to not ban vaping devices was welcomed by the vaping community in the
country, and received approval from the Malaysia E-Vaporisers and Tobacco
Alternative Association (Mevta).

Its president, Allan Foo, said the government made the right decision, as
banning vaping devices could result in an ""underground"" market where such items
would be sold.

This, he said, would cause more harm.

Speaking to the New Sunday Times yesterday, he said regulating the industry was
a good idea and licensing was the key to effectively regulate the use of vaping
devices.

""There must be a benchmark and guidelines for the industry.""

He said licensing was important, as it would curb the sale of substandard
products and allow consumers to make informed decisions on where to purchase
vaping devices and e-liquids.

Acknowledging that there was a grey area in the industry, like the sale of
substandard products that may not have been certified or accredited by agencies,
such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, Foo said licensing
would curb the issue.

""Licensing will prevent irresponsibility on the part of owners (of vaping
devices), aside from stopping unscrupulous parties from making a quick buck by
selling vaping devices. It will also give people an idea as to where to purchase
their e-cigarettes from.""

Compulsory licensing will help govern the industry.

Asked if the contents of e-liquids should be listed on labels, Foo said it would
be a good move, as consumers should know the contents of such items.

He said in the United States, the ingredients used to manufacture e-liquids were
specified on the labels, and there were standards for commercial and home
brewers to abide by, from the products' bottling to processing.

He said another move that could be looked at was getting Malaysian brewers
accredited through the guidelines and standards set in the US and the United
Kingdom.

""The government must regulate and ensure that the products sold follow
standards.

""Mevta is willing to assist the government in the matter, so that there will be
a system of checks and balances in the industry.""

The association, he said, carried out awareness programmes and activities to
educate people on vaping ethics and the correct way of using vaping devices.

In echoing Foo's sentiments, vape shop owner Syamil Adri Samadon said licensing
would add a measure of control in the industry and give the market a boost.

""Regulating the industry is a good move. I think it will give a chance to the
government to see how young entrepreneurs in the industry can be creative.""

He said even though vape shop owners took their business seriously, and educated
customers on the proper way of handling and caring for vaping devices, it would
be better if regulation and licensing were implemented.

Reformed smoker wants to help others quit with new vaping shop in Clacton

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 297 words","


A REFORMED smoker has opened a new e-cigarette shop to encourage others to give
up smoking after the death of his father.

Jamieson Westall, 30, launched Vapours Oven online with partner Cassandra last
year.

After its success, they have now opened a shop in Clacton's High Street, selling
battery-powered vaporizers - which simulate the feeling of smoking.

Using the e-cigarettes is known as vaping.

Mr Westall's father Thomas died due to a smoking-related illness.

The former Clacton County High School pupil said: ""Smoking is what caused my dad
to die.

""He suffered from COPD and, as a result, passed away from heart failure. It was
a huge shock to lose my father when I was quite young.

""Losing him made me realise I didn't want to go the same way and vaping was the
answer for me.

""Vaping has potentially saved the lives of millions of people who suffer from
COPD.

""We have successfully converted most smokers we know on to vaping and we now
want to help more people kick the nasty habit of smoking.""

Mr Westall added: ""We started vaping cig-alikes four years ago.

""Since then the vaping world has grown tremendously and the equipment that is
now available makes it so easy for people to leave cigarettes behind.

""Vaping simply removed the harmful effects of smoking and delivers nicotine in a
far more healthy way.""

Mr Westall fears there could be a tax hike on electronic cigarettes in coming
years as the EU tries to regulate the industry.

They have also been banned on some train lines, as well as sports stadiums and
hospitals.

Mr Westall said: ""We are making a stand and will do whatever we can to put a
stop to this.

""The tax the Government is losing due to people not purchasing cigarettes on a
daily basis is substantial, so we are sure it will do whatever it takes to make
vaping taxable.""

Vaping: More Dangerous Than You Think

Human Relations Media. 2015. $149.95. Streaming rental $24.95. ISBN
9781627060547.

Gr 7 Up--While previous programs by this distributor have covered the issue of
e-cigarettes, this one adds greater depth and newer data to the recreational use
of inhaling substances through water vapors. It highlights the explosion of
vaping products and their attractive packaging--some mimic popular candy and
drink brands--designed to appeal to almost every desire a teen might have. The
film goes on to note the complete lack of purity control, the potential
lethality of higher concentrations of liquid nicotine vaping products, and some
of the adverse metabolic effects. The narrators also point out that online
searches using the phrase ""Is vaping dangerous/harmful"" usually generate results
at the top which are selling products, instead of offering solid information.
This video also covers the increasing use of marijuana vaping, noting that in
doing so teens can decrease their IQ by 8 to 10 points. Even more concerning is
the fact that unlike tobacco smoke, which is mostly expelled by the lungs,
vapors tend to condense and create a chemical stew, which can lead to pneumonia
and other serious health issues. The section covering the vaping of alcohol is
most disturbing and eye-opening. It's so potent that one inhalation can contain
the equivalent of 8 to 10 shots. Because vaping bypasses the stomach and liver,
detoxing is almost impossible, another huge concern. VERDICT The teens sharing
their experiences are eloquent and believable, making this another good video
for schools and libraries to own.--John R. Clark, Harland Public Library, ME

Concerns EU rules could send 'vaping' up in smoke

BYLINE: SARAH WADDINGTON Herald Reporter @sarewaddington

SECTION: NEWS:HEALTH; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 513  words","


E-CIGARETTE suppliers in Plymouth say they are worried new EU regulations could
put an end to their businesses.

New rules surrounding the sale of e-cigarettes and vaping accessories will come
into force in the UK on May 20 this year, it has been revealed.   But with the
dramatic rise of e-cigarette use in Plymouth and the rest of the country, the
controversial rules could have a detrimental affect on the growing industry.

Karen Griffiths swapped smoking for vaping four years ago in a desperate bid to
improve her health. She set up her own vaping business in Plymouth city centre
as a result.

But now the 55-year-old owner of Your Vapour on Cornwall Street, says changes to
the EU's 2001 Tobacco Products Directive could ""wipe out"" a lot of the market.

Mrs Griffiths, who runs the business with her husband Lawrence, and
brother-in-law Trevor, said: ""There does need to be regulations, but there's
certain things within the new regulations that will affect all business in the
UK. They are basically too strict.""

The changes to the EU's 2001 Tobacco Products Directive will include vaping from
May, which will be classed as tobacco-related products. The rules will change
how e-cigarettes and vaping products can be sold and manufactured, as well as
how they can be displayed in shops.

""They've talked about this for the last two years,"" explained Mrs Griffiths,
""and there will be no choice but to implement them in the UK.

""They are not good for vaping shops at all, but having said that it could have
been done a lot differently. [E-cigarettes] will still be available, and
manufacturers and importers will carry on no problem, but there won't be such a
wide range of products. The worst case scenarios is there will be nothing to put
E-Liquid in.""

Earlier this year Public Health England released an independent review stating
e-cigarettes are approximately 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco and have
the potential to help smokers quit smoking.   The review also suggests
e-cigarettes may be contributing to falling smoking rates among adults and young
people.

Ash May quit smoking three years ago and started vaping in its place. The
30-year-old says since then his health has improved; he can breathe easier and
his taste has also got better.

Since he started vaping, Mr May has set up a successful business from his home
in Plympton supplying and delivering vaping products.

Although he says the new regulations won't affect his business ""too much"", Mr
May believes they could be pushed too far..

""It is quite worrying for me,"" he said. ""I've been in business for nearly three
years and have a nice, little business going, but if it does get to that point
and the government intervene and decide to tax [the products] more, it might
mean, not just for me but for many others too,  eventually becoming out of
business.""

Part of the new regulations include new rules on how E-cigarettes work. They
must be leak free, and must provide a consistent dose. Mr May  said: ""There are
some really good products on the market, but there's no such thing as 100 per
cent leak free.""

TFL's vaping ban is unfair

SECTION: LETTERS; Pg. 66

LENGTH: 173 words","


TfL is by no means unusual in bringing in a ban on vaping, nor in its ridiculous
arguments in support of its policy, for example to mitigate fire risk (October
22).

Coffee chains and hospitals have banned vaping, despite there being no evidence
that inhaling water vapour through ""passive vaping"" is a health risk, out of
apparent dislike of anything associated with smoking.

As a smoker for 35-plus years, I believe vaping is the most powerful tool in the
quitter's arsenal so far. By providing a smoking simulation that you can switch
off after a couple of drags, it offers not just a crutch but a framework with
which to break the habit. Surely ""normalising"" vaping is something we should
encourage? James Gray SMOKING has been banned for years on public transport so
why would anyone think it should be different for vaping? The smell is
inoffensive but it still emits a vapour that can enter others' personal space.
I'd rather there wasn't a rule and that people took it on themselves not to
cause discomfort or annoyance to others.

No smoke without fire in this EU nightmare;
The latest emissions scandal is the draconian and health-threatening regulation
being imposed on e-cigarettes

BYLINE: Matt Ridley

SECTION: EDITORIAL; OPINION COLUMNS; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 1111 words","


@mattwridley When regulation goes wrong, people call for more regulation.
Sometimes, though, regulation is the cause of the original problem. It is
steadily becoming clear that the way the European Union does regulation is
especially pernicious. It stifles innovation, often favours danger over safety,
plays into the hands of vested interests and is inflexible and unaccountable.
Volkswagen's case is the tip of the iceberg.

In a shocking new case about dangerous emissions coming to court this week, the
European Commission has passed regulations that are certain - not likely,
certain - to hit the cleanest and lowest-emitting products much harder than
their dirty competitors. I am not talking about diesel versus (cleaner) petrol
engines, though I could be. Nor am I talking about pesticides versus (cleaner)
genetically modified crops. Nor wood-burning versus (cleaner) fracking. I am
talking about smoking versus (cleaner) vaping.

Egged on two years ago, I am sorry to say, by British ministers and some MEPs,
the EU has agreed a tobacco products directive, which has to be implemented into
law by next spring. Its Article 20 concerns the regulation of devices for vaping
nicotine. And it hits them much harder than it hits cigarettes. On Thursday the
vaping manufacturer Totally Wicked goes to the European Court of Justice to
challenge Article 20. They have an excellent case.

For a start, it is bizarre to include vaping devices in a ""tobacco products""
directive at all. It's like regulating coffee in a hard-drugs law. Remember the
evidence is now overwhelmingly strong - and the British government has recently,
but belatedly accepted this - that vaping is a really effective way to quit
smoking and that, far from being a gateway into smoking, it is a highway out. By
some estimates, approaching three million people now vape in this country,
nearly all of whom are smoking less or no tobacco as a result.

Gobsmackingly, the directive specifically outlaws the very vaping devices that
are most useful to heavy smokers trying to quit: the ones with more than 20
milligrams of nicotine per millilitre. Heavy smokers need high-strength nicotine
vapour to quit smoking, so the people with the worst health are going to be
denied help. And by insisting that refillable devices are leak free, the
directive will effectively kill 90 per cent of the devices sold by independent
firms and hand the market back to the struggling non-refillable ""cig-alike"" ones
made mostly by the tobacco firms.

It gets worse. The directive outlaws most vaping advertisements, which will
certainly slow vaping's advance at the expense of smoking - ie, cost lives. It
creates a six-month ""standstill"" period for new vaping products, following
notification by the manufacture of an intention to sell a product. This will
slow innovation and is asking for a black market to thrive: Chinese websites
will be selling new devices into Europe while regulated manufacturers here
twiddle their thumbs for 26 weeks.

But all of this pales into insignificance beside the truly shocking idiocy in
the directive, which is this. From next spring a manufacturer of a vaping device
will have to submit far more information about its emissions than a tobacco
company will have to submit about emissions from smoking devices. Cigarette
makers have to test for just three things: tar, carbon monoxide and nicotine.
There are about 4,000 different chemicals in cigarette smoke, most of which are
toxic at some level, but they don't have to be tested or listed.

Under the new directive, e-cig makers are going to have to measure and list ""all
ingredients contained in, and emissions resulting from the use of, the product,
by brand name and type"" - including toxicological data - even though these
emissions are far lower and far less toxic than tobacco smoke. Remember, the
best evidence suggests that vaping is 20-100 times safer than smoking. But here
we have regulation falling far more heavily on the safer product, just as it
does with genetically modified crops and petrol engines, and making innovation
all but impossible.

The result will be a slowdown in the take-up of vaping and therefore more
premature deaths from smoking, just as the policy of favouring diesel over
petrol has, we now know, probably killed many thousands of Europeans a year.

There is a way for vaping products to avoid these strangulating regulations, and
that is for their makers to apply to have them regulated as medical devices. But
that takes years to get approval and ensures that they are expensive, hard to
get and www.ugly.No medicinal e-cig has been approved in five years. One of the
advantages of vaping devices as quit aids is that they are attractive and can be
bought from ordinary shops without prescriptions.

Now consider how hard it is to challenge Article 20 of the tobacco products
directive, or indeed any Euro-regulation. Once passed in Brussels, it's illegal
for Britain not to implement it, and unpicking it would require 28 nations
agreeing. It won't happen. In a parallel case, the transport secretary, Patrick
McLoughlin, in a letter to The Times on Saturday, detailed Britain's futile
efforts to get agreement on real-world tests for car emissions this year.

As the Volkswagen scandal has beautifully demonstrated, in the EU we are
governed by unelected regulators who are immune to democratic recall, captive
chums of the very industries they regulate and tools of the great pressure
groups that infest the corridors of the Berlaymont. Greens obsessed with carbon
dioxide combined with German carmakers obsessed with diesel to visit more
noxious nitrogen oxides and particulates on us all.

These are not isolated cases: European regulation is not fit for purpose. Sir
James Dyson last week said that he is taking the European Commission to court
because its vacuum cleaner regulations have been influenced by a ""strong German
lobby [that] wanted to test virgin vacuum cleaners in a sterile laboratory
without dust"", because their performance is relatively poor in the real, dusty
world. He calls regulations ""a form of control which stifles progress"" and ""an
argument for greater independence for Britain"".

That is not an extreme conclusion.

If you are one of the country's three million vapers, or you know somebody who
you would like to give up smoking, then you should probably vote to leave the EU
in the referendum next year. I cannot see another way to unpick the lethal
regulations in Article 20 and instead come up with sensible regulations that
protect consumers while encouraging innovation and accelerate switching from
tobacco.

As with petrol engines regulations hit the safer product more heavily

LOCAL E-CIGARETTE CULTURE FLOURISHES;
CONVENTION CIRCUIT REFLECTS GROWING POPULARITY OF VAPING IN REGION

BYLINE: Amy Brooks, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A-1

LENGTH: 770 words","


Mike Chroma stood behind a glass counter displaying batteries, small tanks and
mouthpiece-shaped drip atomizers - all parts to electronic cigarettes. He walked
to the back counter to answer a ringing phone under a line of shelves containing
various e-liquids.

""Pittsburgh Vape Lounge,"" he said, playfully drawing out the ""i.""

Vaping and vape shops have been spreading throughout the Pittsburgh area over
the past two years as the popularity of electronic cigarettes has gained
traction since being introduced to the U.S. market in the late 2000s. Many
consider it a safer - and more acceptable - alternative to tobacco products.

E-cigarettes also are used as a way to quit smoking tobacco. Vapers - as those
who use e-cigarettes are called - tend to stick with the new activity, some as a
hobby, others as a lifestyle. And vaping has become so popular here that
Pittsburgh has attracted its first Vaping Convention Circuit, which will be held
Saturday and Sunday at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown. The
event is free and open to the public from noon to 6 p.m. Visitors must be 18 or
older.

""[Vaping] is as simple or as complex as you want it to be,"" Mr. Chroma explained
as he took pieces out of the glass case in his Brookline shop.

For those who think building a ""mod"" - a modified e-cigarette used by more
experienced vapers - from the individual parts sold at the shop is overwhelming,
there are starter kits that include an e-cigarette, complete with tank and
battery, and a charger. All that's left is to choose a flavor of e-liquid, or
""juice,"" from the more than 200 options available in the shop with names such as
""Unicorn Milk,"" ""Star Drops,"" ""Strawberry"" and ""Rich Tobacco.""

""Thirty-one dollars and three cents is how little it costs you to vape,"" Mr.
Chroma declared, double-checking the total cost, including tax, on the cash
register.

Another way to look at it: $31.03 is how little it costs to quit smoking. Both
Mr. Chroma and Kevin Skipper, owner and founder of the Vaping Convention Circuit
headquartered in Tampa, Fla., were former smokers who quit once they started
vaping.

It's a story that many vapers have and want to share, even though the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration hasn't approved any e-cigarette for smoking-cessation
therapy as it has nicotine patches.

Mr. Skipper is also what is called a ""tobacco harm reduction"" advocate. He,
along with many others in the vaping community, emphasize the difference between
vaping and smoking tobacco. E-cigarettes' key ingredients are atomized vapors -
propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin - and are generally considered safe in
food, but research is lacking on whether they are safe to inhale for the long
haul. The flavoring juices may contain various concentrations of nicotine. The
battery-powered device turns nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals into a
vapor that can be inhaled.

The convention will offer advocacy sessions, nonprofit raffles, battery safety
classes and vendor booths.

""And you can't leave out competitive exhaling!"" joked Pittsburgh Vape Lounge
regular Glen Eckroat of Brookline. He attributed the term for the vapor
cloud-blowing contest to friend and vaper John Derzic. Mr. Derzic of Pittsburgh
is sponsored by vaping companies to represent them during the competition.

Vaping will be allowed inside the convention center, although attendees will
have to go outside to smoke traditional cigarettes.

Vaping indoors is legal everywhere in Pennsylvania except for Philadelphia,
which banned it indoors last year. Still, many vapers use the ""don't be a jerk""
rule when it comes to using e-cigarettes. ""Yeah, people in a restaurant don't
want to smell your Froot Loops when they're eating dinner,"" Mr. Eckroat said.

There also are no regulations enforcing a minimum age to buy e-cigarettes, which
has caused some concern that the vaping industry is attempting to market to
children. Mr. Skipper addresses those worries by enforcing a 18-and-older policy
for the convention.

Vape shops, which sometime include a bar or lounge where people gather to vape,
largely self-regulate. Many of the shops' websites require users to click an
agreement that they are older than 18 before entering, and some shops require
customers to produce a photo ID to purchase products.

Stores like Pittsburgh Vape Loungesuch as well as Villain Vape Shops in Cheswick
and Lawrenceville aim to educate customers about the ins and outs of vaping.

Vapers ""are a very close-knit community of people who understand the struggle to
stop using combustible tobacco, a very supportive community,"" Mr. Skipper said.
""It's almost like an extended family.""

Its Hot: Vape shops at the shore

BYLINE: By Dan McQuade; For The Inquirer

SECTION: unsorted; P-com News; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 812 words","


A lot of the merchandise on the Wildwood boardwalk has a bit of an edge to it.
Cheesy T-shirts advertise sex, drugs, even rock and roll (if that's still
considered edgy). Stores offer tattoos, temporary or permanent. Other shops sell
pipes and bongs ""for tobacco use only.""

Over the last year or two, however, the boardwalk has added another type of
product among the oceanfront shops. The signs advertise vaping, and the stores
sell electronic cigarettes. E-cigarettes come in various forms but all work on
the same general principle: Liquid nicotine at one end is heated into vapor that
is is inhaled through a mouthpiece.

Vape shops, as they've come to be known, line the Wildwood boardwalk. Other
stores simply added vaping devices to their selections of pipes, bongs, and
cigarettes. This month, a shop on Pacific Avenue launched an additional
location: Goodfella's Vaporium, a ""Vegas-style vapor shop in the heart of
Wildwood."" The store features a long ""juice bar"" - as in nicotine juice - where
vaping enthusiasts can puff away in a communal setting. The store is even BYOB.

Goodfella's owner Ron Rotatori also owns the G Spot Hookah Lounge. He started
out working at a vape shop on the boardwalk and eventually learned more than the
proprietor, he said. He struck out on his own, going off the boardwalk because
the rent was cheaper, and opened his first shop last year.

It's not just Wildwood, of course. There are vaping stores in Atlantic City,
where seemingly every novelty shop has long sold cigarettes, pipes, and bongs.
Even Ocean City, with its Methodist origins and boardwalk smoking ban, has a
store in the back of the Surf Mall selling vaping devices. Ocean Cigars, in
town, has also added vaping products to its traditional offerings. Another shop,
Vortex Vapor, operates in Egg Harbor City.

Seagars Smoke Shop opened in 2008 in Stone Harbor and now operates in Rio
Grande. Last year, it launched ""Ocean Vapes"" in the store, dramatically
expanding its line of vape products. Cape May Cigars, in the Washington Street
Mall, also sells vaping products. Vapors Island - vape shops tend to have
ridiculous pun names - opened last year. (There is not a store named Vape May,
mercifully, at least not yet.)

The idea of a smokeless cigarette is not new. The RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. spent
an estimated $300 million developing the smokeless cigarette Premier. Released
to test markets in 1988, it was withdrawn just five months later. The company
later released a revamped version called Eclipse in 1996; it failed to capture
much market share.

The first patent for a ""non-smokable electronic aerosol cigarette"" was filed by
Hon Lik, a pharmacist in China, in 2003. What were then mainly called
e-cigarettes entered the U.S. market in 2007. Word of mouth has spread quickly.
The major tobacco players have gotten into the game: RJ Reynolds markets Vuze,
Lorrilard has Blu, and Altria sells MarkTen. Somewhere along the way, the terms
changed. Instead of e-cigarettes (the device), we got vaping (the act).

At stores down the Shore, vaping devices run anywhere from $40 to hundreds of
dollars; the liquid nicotine ""juice"" runs anywhere from a few bucks to $20.

People take their vaping seriously. There are now events where contestants
compete to blow the biggest vapor cloud or perform tricks with the exhaled
vapor. Starting next month, Goodfella's Vaporium plans to hold weekly vape-cloud
competitions. Vaping enthusiasts have quickly become vaping obsessives. The
flavor of the week at Vapors Island this week is called Nutz. It comes with
tasting notes more suitable to wine: ""A sweet and juicy strawberry preserve
spread . . . with subtle notes of whipped honey creme.""

Many scientists believe e-cigarettes present fewer health risks than traditional
cigarettes. They deliver nicotine, the substance that makes tobacco addictive,
without the tar that makes cigarettes so dangerous. Many smokers have used
vaping to quit, or at least seriously reduce, their cigarette intake, though
there is limited evidence that vaping is superior to medical smoking-cessation
devices like gum, pills, or patches. And not much is known about their long-term
safety.

According to data released by the federal government in April, the percentage of
minors using e-cigarettes tripled from 2013 to 2014. Thirteen percent of high
schoolers now vape. Though teen tobacco use rose for the first time in decades,
cigarette smoking among high schoolers continued to decline, from 9 percent to 6
percent over the same period. The FDA is expected to announce proposed vaporized
nicotine regulations.

Though sales of tobacco still dwarf those of vaping products, a report last year
from Research and Markets said e-cigarette products were expected to increase by
more than 24 percent a year through 2018. The trend, then, doesn't show any
signs of going up in vapor.

Its Hot: Vape shops at the shore

A lot of the merchandise on the Wildwood boardwalk has a bit of an edge to it.
Cheesy T-shirts advertise sex, drugs, even rock and roll (if that's still
considered edgy). Stores offer tattoos, temporary or permanent. Other shops sell
pipes and bongs ""for tobacco use only.""

Over the last year or two, however, the boardwalk has added another type of
product among the oceanfront shops. The signs advertise vaping, and the stores
sell electronic cigarettes. E-cigarettes come in various forms but all work on
the same general principle: Liquid nicotine at one end is heated into vapor that
is is inhaled through a mouthpiece.

Vape shops, as they've come to be known, line the Wildwood boardwalk. Other
stores simply added vaping devices to their selections of pipes, bongs, and
cigarettes. This month, a shop on Pacific Avenue launched an additional
location: Goodfella's Vaporium, a ""Vegas-style vapor shop in the heart of
Wildwood."" The store features a long ""juice bar"" - as in nicotine juice - where
vaping enthusiasts can puff away in a communal setting. The store is even BYOB.

Goodfella's owner Ron Rotatori also owns the G Spot Hookah Lounge. He started
out working at a vape shop on the boardwalk and eventually learned more than the
proprietor, he said. He struck out on his own, going off the boardwalk because
the rent was cheaper, and opened his first shop last year.

It's not just Wildwood, of course. There are vaping stores in Atlantic City,
where seemingly every novelty shop has long sold cigarettes, pipes, and bongs.
Even Ocean City, with its Methodist origins and boardwalk smoking ban, has a
store in the back of the Surf Mall selling vaping devices. Ocean Cigars, in
town, has also added vaping products to its traditional offerings. Another shop,
Vortex Vapor, operates in Egg Harbor City.

Seagars Smoke Shop opened in 2008 in Stone Harbor and now operates in Rio
Grande. Last year, it launched ""Ocean Vapes"" in the store, dramatically
expanding its line of vape products. Cape May Cigars, in the Washington Street
Mall, also sells vaping products. Vapors Island - vape shops tend to have
ridiculous pun names - opened last year. (There is not a store named Vape May,
mercifully, at least not yet.)

The idea of a smokeless cigarette is not new. The RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co. spent
an estimated $300 million developing the smokeless cigarette Premier. Released
to test markets in 1988, it was withdrawn just five months later. The company
later released a revamped version called Eclipse in 1996; it failed to capture
much market share.

The first patent for a ""non-smokable electronic aerosol cigarette"" was filed by
Hon Lik, a pharmacist in China, in 2003. What were then mainly called
e-cigarettes entered the U.S. market in 2007. Word of mouth has spread quickly.
The major tobacco players have gotten into the game: RJ Reynolds markets Vuze,
Lorrilard has Blu, and Altria sells MarkTen. Somewhere along the way, the terms
changed. Instead of e-cigarettes (the device), we got vaping (the act).

At stores down the Shore, vaping devices run anywhere from $40 to hundreds of
dollars; the liquid nicotine ""juice"" runs anywhere from a few bucks to $20.

People take their vaping seriously. There are now events where contestants
compete to blow the biggest vapor cloud or perform tricks with the exhaled
vapor. Starting next month, Goodfella's Vaporium plans to hold weekly vape-cloud
competitions. Vaping enthusiasts have quickly become vaping obsessives. The
flavor of the week at Vapors Island this week is called Nutz. It comes with
tasting notes more suitable to wine: ""A sweet and juicy strawberry preserve
spread . . . with subtle notes of whipped honey creme.""

Many scientists believe e-cigarettes present fewer health risks than traditional
cigarettes. They deliver nicotine, the substance that makes tobacco addictive,
without the tar that makes cigarettes so dangerous. Many smokers have used
vaping to quit, or at least seriously reduce, their cigarette intake, though
there is limited evidence that vaping is superior to medical smoking-cessation
devices like gum, pills, or patches. And not much is known about their long-term
safety.

According to data released by the federal government in April, the percentage of
minors using e-cigarettes tripled from 2013 to 2014. Thirteen percent of high
schoolers now vape. Though teen tobacco use rose for the first time in decades,
cigarette smoking among high schoolers continued to decline, from 9 percent to 6
percent over the same period. The FDA is expected to announce proposed vaporized
nicotine regulations.

Though sales of tobacco still dwarf those of vaping products, a report last year

more than 24 percent a year through 2018. The trend, then, doesn't show any
signs of going up in vapor.

Wolves u-turn over e-cig smoking in stadium

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 223 words","


WARRINGTON Wolves have reversed their decision to allow fans to smoke
e-cigarettes on the stands.

The Warrington Guardian had previously reported the move coincided with a new
sponsorship deal which will see Truvape take over sponsorship of the South Stand
and Wolves branded e-cigs on sale in the club shop.

But two weeks later, club officials announced vaping would not be allowed
throughout the stadium and there would be designated 'vaping areas'.

A spokesman added: ""The lifting of the stadium ban will apply only in the
stadium concourse.

""It was never the intention that vaping would be allowed indiscriminately
throughout the whole of the stadium.

""While the vapour emitted from electronic cigarettes is in no way comparable to
second-hand smoke from tobacco cigarettes, in terms of odour or harmfulness to
bystanders, both Warrington Wolves and Truvape want to ensure that all Wolves
fans, whether vapers or non-vapers, are able to fully enjoy their match-day
experience.

""As of this weekend's pre-season friendlies vaping will be permitted but only in
designated vaping areas within the SW concourse, NW concourse and NE quadrant.
All other areas of the stadium will remain no vaping.""

Signs will be in place to advise spectators of where the vaping areas are and
the club added the Halliwell Jones Stadium remains a 'No smoking' venue.

Chambersburg holds off on 'vaping' ban

SECTION: NEWS; Local

LENGTH: 412 words","


CHAMBERSBURG &GT;&GT; Borough council voted Monday night to postpone a
resolution that would ban its employees from using electronic cigarettes and
vaporizers   or ""vaping""   while at work.

Representatives from three labor unions agreed they preferred to address the
issue of extending an existing tobacco ban to electronic nicotine delivery
systems during contract negotiations.

Receiving consent from the labor unions is necessary to move forward with the
motion to extend the tobacco ban to include vaping while on duty.

Borough manager Jeffrey Stonehill said he is concerned about the image of
borough employees vaping at work, but accepted that unless there is an actual
ban, there is nothing he can do to stop his employees from doing so.

""Our employees can, theoretically, vape on duty,"" he said. ""That's not the image
we want of our employees, driving trucks and vehicles and working at the sewer
plant and mowing parks (while) vaping. It seems ridiculous to me.""

Vaporizers are small devices which heat a liquid to create water-based vapor
rather than burning tobacco to create smoke. Stonehill told Public Opinion prior
to Monday's meeting that because vaping products don't contain tobacco, it was
unclear whether they are prohibited.

Councilman William McLaughlin said he believes the unions would be concerned
about their members' health and that if they wanted to keep their vaping rights,
the council could consider a solution.

""Perhaps they'd be willing to negotiate a settlement that we'll allow vaping in
return for a higher contribution to their healthcare insurance,"" he said to a
couple of chuckles from others.

Stonehill then emphasized that all the unions had said they were willing to
negotiate.

Cpl. Ian Armstrong, a Chambersburg Police Officers Association representative,
explained none of the officers vape and that his union isn't looking to get
anything in return for the ban, it's simply easier to talk about it during
contract negotiations.

""We have a 32 page contract,"" he said. ""Doing it as part of our contract
negotiations is just a simplicity.""

Council won't have to wait long since the police and firefighters' contracts are
slated to expire within a year and the AFSCME contract will expire in December
of 2016   so negotiations will likely start in the coming months, said borough
secretary Jamia Wright.

Wright added the negotiations are usually done in private, but the outcome will
be made public.

The next council meeting will be on Feb. 23.

INDOOR VAPING BAN TO INCLUDE SOME SMOKE SHOPS;
CITY

BYLINE:  by BRYNA GODAR

SECTION: THE CAP TIMES; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 640 words","


With the addition of vaping to Madison's indoor smoking ban, some smoke shops
will no longer be allowed to have customers test electronic cigarettes, vaping
devices and flavors.

The Madison City Council added vaping to the indoor public smoking ban Jan. 6,
prohibiting the use of electronic delivery devices in places like restaurants,
stores, theaters and most indoor workplaces.

That ban also applies to any shops selling e-cigarettes that derive less than 75
percent of their revenue from the devices or related products.

Stores dedicated solely to vaping ? like Madtown Vapor and Huffle Puff Vapes ?
will still be able to have customers try out the products in-store, since nearly
100 percent of their revenue relates to vaping.

Some other places that have a mix of tobacco products and electronic products,
however, will likely not be able to continuing sampling.

Huffle Puff Vapes owner Kevin DeBauch said he's not at all concerned for his
shop, since it is exclusively an e-cigarette business, but he is concerned for
smaller establishments.

""I do understand that they need to do that, but I do feel that 75 percent is
fairly high, especially for some of the head shops downtown and some of the
smaller smoke shops that want to be able to get into e-cigarettes,"" DeBauch
said. ""We want to be helping people get away from cigarettes, not forcing them
to stay on them.""

Many have credited e-cigarettes with their ability to quit smoking and studies
have shown it's an effective cessation tool.

""We have a lot of ways of helping people who are nicotine-addicted,"" said
District 15 Ald. David Ahrens, listing gum or nicotine patches. ""For many people
that doesn't work because they need the hand-mouth thing, the smoking rhythm ?
there are just rituals and things that go along with smoking that the other
non-tobacco nicotine delivery systems aren't effective.""

Ahrens attempted to lower the sales threshold to 33 percent, based on a prior
threshold for tobacco bars. That amendment failed, however, with the cut-off
staying at 75 percent.

""I think that the threshold honestly is too high,"" said Therin Erdahl, a
salesperson at Knuckleheads. Though Knuckleheads is grandfathered in by the ban
to allow tobacco use in-store, he thinks the threshold should have been set at
the suggested 33 percent instead.

""I can see this making a lot of stores that do sell vapor products being
excluded from selling vapor products,"" Erdahl said.

Customers and salespeople say a huge part of the process of switching over is
being able to test the device, learning how to use it and trying different
flavors.

Smokes on State owner Jason Clark declined to comment on the 75 percent
threshold and could not be reached last week, and two other mixed tobacco and
vaping shops did not respond to calls for comment.

Madtown Vapors owner Dino Spinelli, however, said he is actually against shops
that sell both tobacco and vaping elements.

""We are anti-tobacco here. To me, I think the people who don't know anything
about it, when they see it grouped into a tobacco shop, that's not how I want it
to be grouped,"" Spinelli said.

""We sell vaping equipment to get people off tobacco, and the last thing I'd want
to have is tobacco right next to my vaping element.""

Those arguing for the higher threshold at the council meeting said they did not
want to have people vaping in convenience stores or gas stations that sell
electronic cigarettes. Electronic delivery devices make up a small portion of
those stores' available merchandise, however, and many opponents balked at the
idea that vaping-related products could comprise 33 percent of a Walgreens'
sales.

The other in-store restriction originally included in the ordinance was the
requirement for stores to be open by Feb. 1, 2015, to qualify for the exception.
That piece was omitted through an amendment Ahrens also proposed.

Confusion over e-cigarettes

SECTION: Comment; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 554 words","


THE government must produce a cogent and clear articulation of its position with
respect to vaping and e-cigarettes. There appears to be some confusion about
which direction the sector should take. The Health Ministry seems to lean
towards prohibition, deciding that only licensed pharmacists and registered
medical practitioners were allowed to supply e-cigarette liquids containing
nicotine. They must also keep a record of the sale of the item. The decision was
the result of a discussion held by a special task force headed by the ministry
to examine the issue of e-cigarettes. Rural and Regional Development Minister
Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, however, was more concerned about Malay vape
sellers incurring losses as a result of the Health Ministry's pronouncement.
""Vape sellers can no longer run their businesses because big companies own
pharmacies,"" he had pointed out.

The Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry, on the other hand,
wants to formulate guidelines and price adjustments for such products, while
Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin suggested banning both conventional
cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Apparently, everyone has an opinion on
e-cigarettes, said to be the new cool kid on the block ""with candy flavours and
the trendy nickname of vaping"". Vaping communities are concentrated in the Klang
Valley and Johor, but Ipoh, Kedah and Penang are catching up fast, according to
one report. At rough estimate, there are a million vapers nationwide - about 10
per cent of whom are under 18. Some 35,000 visitors attended Malaysia's first
vaporiser convention held in Kuala Lumpur in June. And, there are at least 1,000
vape shops across the country and more than 400 local mod (electronic vaporiser
device) and juice (e-liquid) brands.

Science has not yet resolved whether vaping is less dangerous than cigarettes.
But, deputy director-general of Health Datuk Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman says there
are sufficient global studies showing that vaping is detrimental to health. It
is useful to remind ourselves that World Health Organisation scientists only
found out that smoking traditional cigarettes caused cancer in the 1960s. But
people had picked up the smoking habit long before the release of a definitive
report on the dreadful harm of cigarettes. It is possible that vaping will be a
""gateway"" to smoking conventional cigarettes, especially among the younger
generation, say doctors. The nicotine in the solution is likely to be addictive
which could influence teenagers to smoke cigarettes in the future. Nobody is
questioning the people's right to vape or smoke. At the same time, until more
information is available, it is better to err on the side of caution when it
comes to the damaging effects of vaping. The Los Angeles Times, in calling for a
tightening of the rules on e-cigarettes, says new information suggests that they
""are looking less and less like benign alternatives to traditional smoking"".
""Teenagers are apparently taking up the so-called vaping habit in droves and
now, we're also learning that the exhaled vapour contains multiple harmful
chemicals."" Public policy on vaping must factor in the following - protection
for minors and caution about allowing vaping in indoor settings, given that the
health effects of second-hand vapour are not known.

What on earth is vaping - and should you let staff do it at work?

HAVING just turned 29 I am still trying to stay reasonably in touch with current
trends. This includes using social media, but recently I have started to hear
more obscure phrases (which I sometimes google so as to keep up with the times).
I remember the (fleeting) satisfaction of knowing what ""the harlem shake"" was; I
also now know what ""twerking"" and ""neknominations"" are (not that I have taken
part in, or would encourage either!), but the term ""vaping"" caught me by
surprise. I am talking about e-cigarettes, which according to latest figures
around 1.3 million Britons apparently now smoke.

Battery powered e-cigarettes are largely odourless and contain some of the
addictive substances found in regular cigarettes, but apparently without the
smoke and the smelly fingers. When heated by the battery, e-cigarettes produce a
vapour that can be inhaled - hence the term ""vaping"". So why should anyone care?
Maybe you are an employer who has been asked if staff can ""vape"" in the office
or you are a co-worker who disagrees with ""vaping"". Either way, opinion seems to
be split. The pro-vapers argue that because e-cigarettes do not contain any tar
or omit smoke and allegedly present no risk of passive smoking (based on the
medical information currently available), they should be actively encouraged as
a potentially ""healthy"" alternative to regular smoking, even helping people
quit. But the anti-vapers say that too little is known about the real effects of
""vaping"" to determine the long term health implications and it might even
encourage non-smokers to take up ""vaping"". The BMA has suggested that
e-cigarettes should be included in the smoking ban, but as yet, there has been
no indication that the Government intends to legislate. So until then, what
should employers do? We recommend that as a minimum a discussion is had with
staff and co-workers. Garner views and give consideration to preparing some kind
of a policy on ""vaping"" (for example, will you allow it in the workplace?), so
if, or when, the issue does arise, whilst you may not have all the answers, you
are ready to deal with it.

""Vaping"" has reminded me not only that I am starting to get old, but also of the
importance of keeping up with the times. With this in mind, employers should
make sure that they regularly review their contracts, policies and procedures to
check that they too are not reflecting their age! Chris Aldridge is a solicitor

`It's up to states to stop vape sales'

KUALA LUMPUR: Despite the cabinet's decision not to ban vaping nationwide, it is
up to the state government to stop the sale of vaping products as seen in Johor,
Kelantan, Penang and Kedah.

Deputy Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahya said local authorities could
enforce by-laws on goods sold.

""Each state can enforce by-laws on the goods sold at various premises. It is up
to them to enforce the law on selling vaping items,"" he said yesterday.

However, he said the Health Ministry's decision not to ban vaping remained.

""The cabinet has decided not to ban vaping,"" he said.

The ministry, however, is in the midst of amending the Tobacco Act 2004. Once
amended, shops will not be allowed to sell e-liquids to youth aged 18 and below.

Vape users will also have to stay away from non-smoking zones.

Dr Hilmi said the police would arrest those vaping with dangerous drugs.

This is after foreign reports show that vape users are mixing drugs like
methamphetamine (syabu) and marijuana in their vaping fluids.

Bangor to consider vaping ordinance

BYLINE: Evan Belanger BDN Staff

LENGTH: 438 words","


BANGOR, Maine -- The City Council will consider an ordinance to prohibit ""vaping
"" via electronic cigarettes and other devices in all public places where state
law currently prohibits smoking.


The proposed ordinance would additionally provide a 20-foot buffer around all
playground and picnic areas in city parks where both smoking and vaping would be
prohibited. Smoking is currently allowed in city parks.


Voting 4-1 Monday night, the council's Government Operations Committee approved
a motion from Councilor Joe Baldacci to recommend the ordinance to the full
council.


Director of Health and Community Services Patty Hamilton estimated tentatively
that it would take city staff about a month to draft the proposal.


The decision came as Hamilton approached the committee with a recommendation to
add vaping to the city's tobacco-use policy for city employees. During
discussion, she suggested the ordinance as a more comprehensive option.


The committee agreed.


""There's just so many unknowns about this vaping,"" said Councilor Patricia
Blanchette. ""To ignore it is dangerous because people are being exposed to all
these poisons.""


Hamilton told the committee that the short- and long-term health effects of
vaping nicotine were unknown, but studies had shown it contained formaldehyde, a
known carcinogen, and that e-cigarette use was growing among minors.


According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a 2014 youth
survey showed that 13.4 percent of high school students and 3.9 percent of
middle school students admitted to vaping within the past 30 days.


Councilor Pauline Civiello, who chairs the committee, cast the only dissenting
vote, saying that treating vaping the same as smoking went beyond what she felt
the City Council could ""comfortably pass"" and that prohibiting smoking in
portions of city parks required more discussion.


""As soon as we say you can't smoke in a park, then you're going to tell people
they can't smoke on the sidewalk while they're walking their dog,"" she said. ""I
just have a problem with that. Where do we stop?""


Councilor's Baldacci, Blanchette, Nelson Durgin and Gibran Graham voted in
favor.


State law currently bans smoking in all workplaces and public places, including
bars and restaurants with several specific exemptions such as hotel rooms
designated for smoking. It also bans smoking in cars when any person under the
age of 16 is present.


Baldacci's motion included a provision to ban vaping in cars when minors are
present.


The Bangor proposal comes about a month after the Portland City Council banned
vaping in public places.

survey showed that 13.4 percent of high school students and 3.9 percent of
middle school students admitted to vaping within the past 30 days.


Councilor Pauline Civiello, who chairs the committee, cast the only dissenting
vote, saying that treating vaping the same as smoking went beyond what she felt
the City Council could ""comfortably pass"" and that prohibiting smoking in
portions of city parks required more discussion.


""As soon as we say you can't smoke in a park, then you're going to tell people
they can't smoke on the sidewalk while they're walking their dog,"" she said. ""I
just have a problem with that. Where do we stop?""


Councilor's Baldacci, Blanchette, Nelson Durgin and Gibran Graham voted in
favor.


State law currently bans smoking in all workplaces and public places, including
bars and restaurants with several specific exemptions such as hotel rooms
designated for smoking. It also bans smoking in cars when any person under the
age of 16 is present.


Baldacci's motion included a provision to ban vaping in cars when minors are
present.


The Bangor proposal comes about a month after the Portland City Council banned
vaping in public places.

Unregulated vaping business is booming; Pop-ups not monkeying around

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A3

DATELINE: NULL


A man dressed as a gorilla stood on the corner of College Avenue and Broad
Street a few weeks ago.

He held a sign pointing rush-hour drivers to one of the city's e-cigarette
shops. The gorilla suit is novel enough, but what's more of a marvel is how many
stores selling e-cigarettes (which electronically vaporize liquid nicotine for
inhalation - also known as vaping) exist in the city.

""They're popping up all over,"" said Brett Bostick, who opened Planet of the
Vapes nine months ago.

A few years ago, there wasn't a single store in the city selling e-cigarettes.
Now, there are at least five, with many more vaping entrepreneurs operating out
of their homes. Most opened within the last year.

Thomas Maier operates Vaping the Way, which opened in the fall.

At first, he was importing the products and selling them to his friends. Then he
got busier and busier. Before he knew it, he was looking for a storefront.

""We're looking at opening up a second store now,"" he said.

Much has been made about the health arguments of vaping. Those who advocate on
behalf of the e-cigarette are relentless and the stories of how it helps you
quit smoking are endless. Research, because of the industry's infancy, is slim.

Maier isn't an oddity in the business of vaping. Many of his counterparts got
into the business in the same way he did. They used the product, recognized
benefits, started selling them to friends, business grew, shops were opened.

Bostick was 21 years old and studying engineering at the University of Regina
when he opened up shop. Business started booming, keeping up with studies got
harder, so he dropped out. Like Maier, he's making enough money to consider
expanding: a second shop is planned to open this spring in Moose Jaw.

One shop owner said he makes about $60,000 in sales every month off of
e-cigarettes. A starter kit can be had for as low as $50, but most average out
closer to $100.

It's clear the times are good for vape shops, but it's less clear how long the
good times will roll for the shopkeepers. Health Canada is pondering regulation,
but for now e-cigarettes fall into a grey area. Until that happens, the market
is wide open.

""There (are) usually profit opportunities in unregulated markets,"" said George
Hartner, a University of Regina political scientist.

For now - even as the market in Regina gets saturated with retailers - it's a
relatively low-risk market to enter. That could change when - and at this point,
it seems inevitable - regulation comes in.

Most retailers are - and this could be a first - hoping that happens sooner
rather than later.

""We want regulation. We want to look more toward the regulations that shops
can't sell to minors, that the juice be regulated. We want to know exactly
what's going into (the products) and that it's made in a safe environment, clean
rooms, things like that,"" said Maier.

For now, the industry is self-regulated. While selling e-cigarettes and
importing product might get harder with regulation, it will also make it a much
more difficult market to enter.

""Regulation does create a barrier to entry and essentially makes it more costly
to start that business,"" said Hartner. ""Once you're in the industry and you're
selling, you want as many barriers to entry at that point because that helps to
ensure you maintain market power.""

For now, that market power appears to rest in the hands of the overnight
entrepreneurs who opened up shops in the city before everyone - including
regulators - could say ""gorilla.""

Huffing and puffing: Vaping community fights back

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 690 words","


Jan. 20--ASHLAND -- Local vape shop owners are steamed.

The Ashland city commission agreed in principle last week to amend its
anti-smoking ordinance and ban e-cigarette use inside public places. Some
advocates for vaporized cigarettes believe the decision to usher ""vapers""
outdoors is shortsighted.

""For the city to add this to a tobacco policy is unfair to the industry,"" said
Chuck Riesbeck, owner of NoSmoke Vapor Shoppe. ""It's vapor. It's not smoke.""

Riesbeck said he launched his downtown business to help others quit smoking
after he escaped a longtime tobacco addiction by shifting to vapor. He
encourages customers to practice ""responsible vaping"" but doesn't believe
secondhand vape is harmful.

Mayor Chuck Charles does.

""When you've got a chemical that's used in anti-freeze, it doesn't take much to
realize it's harmful,"" said Charles. ""My concern is the health of the public.""

Whether or not exhaled puffs from e-cigarettes are harmful for others to inhale
is hotly debated in the U.S. Few studies point toward secondhand vape causing
damage to health. A 2014 study by the International Journal of Hygiene and
Environmental Health suggested e-cigarettes emit pollutants into the air that
don't escape ventilated rooms.

But that study -- like most centered on e-cigarettes -- involved a small sample
size and couldn't equate the dangers of smoking with vaping. After four years of
research, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to start
regulating all e-cigarette sales in 2016.

The FDA may slap the e-cig companies with million-dollar paperwork called
""Pre-Market Tobacco Applications."" Those regulations could prove devastating for
the vaping industry, which is mostly consumer generated, according to District 4
Vapor co-owner Jerry Goodwin.

""It's a misconception. This industry is not run by big tobacco,"" Goodwin said.
""These products are made by USA manufacturers, mom-and-pop and small-town
businesses.""

Goodwin and his wife, Melissa, own and operate District 4, a spacious shop on
29th Street that offers a sampling bar and lounging area. The Goodwins are
strongly opposed to Ashland's proposed amendment to its anti-smoking ordinance.

""People are afraid of what they don't understand,"" said Melissa Goodwin. ""Vaping
has helped me quit smoking. It's put more years on my life. [Legislation] should
come down to the burden of proof, just like in court. There is no burden.""

E-cigarette samples at District 4 and NoSmoke Vapor -- and most vape shops --
are nicotine free and usually flavored. Riesbeck feared the addition of vaping
to the city ordinance would prohibit sampling. ""If I can't allow people to try
this, it's going to move me out,"" he said.

But vape shops would receive exemption to the proposed ban on indoor vaping,
Charles said.

Local shop owners are mainly concerned increased legislation will deter smokers
from abandoning cigarettes and hurt business, although not all customers vape to
kick a habit.

""I've never smoked. This is the only thing I've ever tried and I like it,"" said
Chris Jaworski, 21.

""It's healthier and a fun alternative to smoking,"" said Tiffany Travis, 20.

Jaworski and Travis, both of Flatwoods, inhaled sample flavors at District 4 on
Monday. The shop is one of six operating in Ashland. The Goodwins said the city
can expect a unified fight against the amendment from other shop owners and
e-cig users.

""Vaping is a community,"" said Melissa Goodwin.

""We're a big, tight-knit group,"" said Jerry Goodwin. ""We're going to push. The
city's going to do what they want to do, but we have several national advocacy
groups that will be coming to our aid. I think the controversy's a little bit
bigger than what they were expecting.""

No ban on sale of vape in Negri

BYLINE: Teoh Pei Ying

SECTION: Pg. 10

LENGTH: 298 words","


SEREMBAN: THE sale of e-cigarettes or vape-related products will not be banned
in Negri Sembilan despite vaping being declared haram (prohibited) for Muslims,
said Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan.

Commenting on the National Fatwa Council's decree on vaping yesterday, Mohamad
said it would be unfair to impose similar rules on non-Muslims in the state,
adding that the business of selling such products was a different matter
altogether.

Vaping and the sale of related products had been banned in Johor, Kelantan,
Terengganu, Kedah and Malacca.

""The (Negri Sembilan) state fatwa council has adhered to the National Fatwa
Council's ruling. Hence, it is a haram only for Muslims. But it would be unfair
to include the non-Muslims (under the fatwa). We are living in a multicultural
society.

""We will not take any measure against vaping business unless there is an
instruction from the Federal Government or a law for the products not to be sold
openly. The selling of vapes or its business is a separate matter.""

Speaking after chairing the state executive council meeting, Mohamad reminded
religious enforcement officers not to be overzealous in discharging their duties
as the penalty for Muslims found vaping had yet to be gazetted.

He said despite the decree, it would be up to the Muslim individual whether he
or she wanted to quit vaping.

""I hope the enforcement officers will not go about detaining those found vaping
in public areas. The penalty has yet to be gazetted. As of now, it is against
the law to vape in areas where smoking is prohibited.""

The Health Ministry had, in November, said there would be no ban on vaping under
existing laws, and the sale of e-liquids containing nicotine could be supplied
only by licensed pharmacists and registered medical practitioners.

Nanaimo 'vapers' delighted by British health findings; Study: 'e-cigarettes'
found to be 95 per cent less harmful than regular cigarettes

BYLINE: Darrell Bellaart, Daily News

SECTION: REGION; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 390 words","


Local retailers of personal vapourizers welcome news from a U.K. health
regulator that the devices are considerably safer than cigarettes.

Public Health England released results of a study that found the use of personal
vapourizers, or vaping, to be 95 per cent safer than smoking tobacco.

The devices are often called e-cigarettes, but retailers prefer the term
personal vapourizers to avoid the negative connotation of tobacco.

""I think it's great for the industry,"" said Gino Capone, of Nanaimo's Simatech
Vapour Shop. Skyleen Blacklaw, 26, smoked up to two packs a day, when less than
two years ago she noticed many of her friends vaping.She decided to give it a
try and now she sells vaping devices at Simatech. ""It wasn't really a hard
transition at all,"" Blacklaw said. When customers ask her the pros and cons of
vaping, she tells them since switching, ""I feel a lot healthier.""

The PHE review concludes vapourizers are ""significantly less harmful to health
than tobacco and have the potential to help smokers quit smoking."" Key findings:
Best estimates are vapourizers are around 95 per cent less harmful than smoking;
roughly half of Britons don't know vaping is much less harmful than smoking and
there is ""no evidence"" vaping encourages smoking in children or non-smokers.

Vaping may contribute to falling smoking rates among adults and young people,
PHE said. Almost all of the 2.6 million Great Britain adults who vape are
current or ex-smokers. Most use the devices to help quit or to prevent returning
to cigarettes.

Fewer than one per cent of adults and young people who have never smoked are
becoming regular e-cigarette users.

However, the evidence ""raises concerns that increasing numbers of people think
e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than smoking,"" the report said.

Island Health isn't ready to recommend vaping to smokers having trouble
quitting.

""Don't forget, it's safer than tobacco doesn't mean it's safe,"" said Dr. Paul
Hasselback, Island Health medical health officer for the Central Island, adding
debate about vaping's role continues.

""There may be a role for the product as a cessation aide.

""At this time there is a lack of clarity as to what we should be providing to
the physician community as to what the role is of e-cigarettes in supporting
cessation.""

Kelantan, Terengganu crack down on vaping

BYLINE: Kalbana Perimbanayagam; Adrian David

SECTION: Pg. 21

LENGTH: 380 words","


KOTA BARU: KELANTAN and Terengganu have become the latest states to crack down
on vaping.

In Kota Baru, the Kelantan government yesterday announced that shops selling
vape devices and related items must cease operations from Jan 1.

State Local Government, Housing and Sports Committee Exco chairman Datuk Abdul
Fattah Mahmood said vape shops and related business operators had been given 14
days to cease operations.

""We have issued notices to the shops concerned.

""Those who fail to adhere to the directive will face the consequences.""

He said among the action that would be taken included seizure of vape devices on
sale and other related items.

Speaking after a closed-door meeting with officials from the Health Ministry,
police and the state's Religious Department at Kota Darul Naim complex here,
Fattah said the decision to ban the sale of vape devices was made after a
discussion on the pros and cons of vaping.

Fattah, however, said the authorities here had not decided to ban vaping in
public or designated smoking areas in Kelantan.

At present, most of the 350 vape outlets in the state are operating from
premises selling electronic and multi-purpose items.

On the fate of shops only selling the flavoured nicotine glycol or refills for
vape devices, Fattah said this came under the jurisdiction of the Health
Ministry and it was up to the ministry to act.

In Kuala Terengganu, the state government has also frozen the issuance of new
bussiness licences for vape products.

Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Ahmad Razif Abdul Rahman said the state government
would wait for a Federal Government directive before deciding whether those
operating would be allowed to carry on with their operations.

""This is to avoid any confusion and to standardise regulations.""

Prior to this, Johor became the first state to issue a ban on vaping from Jan 1
following a decree by Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar.

Many commercial and business complexes nationwide have also discouraged vaping
in public.

The ministry is studying laws to implement a blanket ban on vaping in view of
the health hazard it poses.

It is also studying laws to regulate the sale of vaping products.

In recent years, vaping has become a trend among Malaysians, not only among
cigarette smokers but also among non-smokers.

Beltrami County Commissioners approve nicotine-free vaping

BYLINE: Crystal Dey, The Bemidji Pioneer, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 432 words","


Dec. 04--BEMIDJI -- Nicotine-free sampling at vaping shops is legal in Beltrami
County.

In a unanimous vote, commissioners compromised on and passed revisions to the
tobacco ordinances that were previously written in a way that would make
sampling of vaping liquid at Northern Vapes, Bemidji's only vaping shop,
illegal.

""We'll just keep doing things as we have been,"" said Matt Bewley, Northern Vapes
owner. Bewley only samples with nicotine-free vaping liquid in his shop.

The second reading of the ordinances on Nov. 19 resulted in a 3-to-2 vote in
which Commissioners Jim Lucachick and Tim Sumner voted against passing Ordinance
38A if it prohibited sampling. Lucachick asked at that time, and again Tuesday
night, there be a compromise.

""Don't paint me like I want to get e-cigarettes out to middle schoolers and all
that,"" Lucachick said. ""Don't sensationalize me that way, please.""

Lucachick said he's always been in favor of revisions to the ordinances, but
thought closing a ""sampling loophole"" for businesses went a step too far.

Commissioners Richard Anderson and Jack Frost have continually voiced strong
opposition against allowing vaping. Creation of hookah lounges and insufficient
scientific evidence were among their, and the other commissioner's concerns.

Frost said he was concerned sampling would open exploitation by business owners
other than Bewley in the future.

""I have no doubt that the local merchandiser of e-cigarettes has intentions that
are honorable. His motives are pure,"" said Commissioner Joe Vene. He added that
concern arises when it comes to enforcement of the product being non-nicotine.

Sheriff Phil Hodapp said he was not sure how law enforcement would enforce the
law short of going into a business and testing the product which would require
probable cause, seizure and obtaining a search warrant.

""That would make that part of the law virtually unenforceable,"" Hodapp said.

Section 4 of Ordinance 38A outlines where smoking is permitted in the county.
Until Tuesday night it contained a subdivision that would prevent sampling of
tobacco products in a shop. Nicotine liquid used in vaping devices is considered
a tobacco product.

Beltrami County Attorney Tim Faver will be rewriting that subdivision to allow
for non-nicotine products, electronic or otherwise, to be allowed.

Ordinance 29 pertains to the tobacco licensing and sales regulations which has
been adjusted to include vaping liquid and devices.

Concerned about vaping article

Editor of the Reformer:

The Jan. 10 article on the vaping business moving into Brattleboro (""Growing
industry) concerns me for two reasons. It gave the impression   which is
unsupported   that electronic nicotine products are a safe quitting aid for
smoking tobacco. Second, the popularity of e-cigarettes puts our youth at risk
of future addiction; our town should take caution before opening our community's
doors to that risk.

According to many sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, no scientific studies have proven that e-cigs actually help people
to quit smoking. The FDA states that ""(e)-cigarettes have not been fully
studied, so consumers currently don't know: ... how much nicotine or other
potentially harmful chemicals are being inhaled during use, or whether there are
any benefits associated with using these products."" A recent systematic review
of 76 existing studies on the health consequences of electronic cigarettes was
put out in December 2014. It says that ""... no firm conclusions can be drawn on
the safety of ECs. However, they can hardly be considered harmless.""

The Vermont Department of Health does not support the use of e-cigarettes for
quitting smoking. Smokers who are ready to quit smoking should take advantage of
proven quit tools: nicotine replacement therapy (free in Vermont) in combination
with individual, group or phone cessation counseling. Visit 802Quits.org or call
1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669) for free quit coaching and support.

Second, we must consider how vaping and vaping lounges are being perceived by
youth. The Centers for Disease Control's reports that ""(w)hen smoking is
portrayed as a social norm among others who are seen as cool, sophisticated,
rebellious, or fun-loving, teens often respond by copying the behavior and
trying cigarettes themselves."" Vaping is no different.

Our town should be especially cautious in allowing vaping lounges into the
community. This concern is foretold best in an e-news article on VaporCode.com ,
which begins ""The latest sensation to hit the youth culture is vaping lounges
and the popularity is growing exponentially."" Granted, our community could use
more places for 18 to 21 year old young adults to hang out. But vapor lounges
should not be what our town has to offer. Police-Fire Project not transparent
enough

Editor of the Reformer:

At the Jan. 2 Selectboard meeting, Judy Davidson and George Reed-Savory offered
even-handed criticism of the town's process around the Police-Fire Project and
the budget. The process has been half-done from the start. At the Representative
Town Meeting in 2012, where the PFP was approved, the moderator violated the
rules of the meeting. He improperly reserved the first 40 minutes of the meeting
for former Selectboard Chairman Dick DeGray to pass the microphone to other PFP
supporters, and there was, in effect, limited time for debate. After multiple
objections the moderator proclaimed, ""We don't operate by Roberts Rules: We
operate by our own rules."" Of the rules in our charter the moderator flagrantly
violated debate Rules 1 and 2. He also violated the two-minute speaking limit
that the moderator customarily announces. The moderator even invented a new
rule: the PFP proponent had ""unrestricted limited time"" in speaking for the
proposal. Therefore, the vote was illegitimate.

The PFP team had a two-part plan at that RTM meeting in 2012: push the PFP and
the 1 percent tax together. The 1 percent tax was supposed to pay for half of
the project and prevent a big property tax increase. Unfortunately most of that
half would still come from Brattleboro residents, because more downtown shopping
is by Brattleboro residents than by tourists, according to a study by Building a
Better Brattleboro. RTM clumsily approved the PFP and rejected the tax. Later
the project was cut back by 7 percent, but the new price tag did not include the
hidden cost of mandatory upgrades to the municipal center. Even after further
cost-saving review the last version of the project included $186,500 for new
furniture. How can renters and property-tax payers in town trust this kind of
process?

Workers for Brattleboro Common Sense found paper records at town hall (not on
the town website) of the earliest PFP committee meetings in 1997. The
committee's first points of inquiry were renovation or new construction and
which architects to hire. They never considered other less expensive remedies:
only construction. The discussion has been one-sided, and the vote was dubious.

The PFP should be started over, and a better process should be followed.
Brattleboro Common Sense has placed ""pro-democracy amendments"" on the ballot in
March. These will advance voter participation and provide the people with better
control over budgetary excess.

Editor of the Reformer:

I will not be in town for the Westminster Town Meeting so I am expressing my
concerns now prior regarding the high cost of sports within the school district.
First I am asking Mr. Chris Kibbe to give this total figure to the Westminster
Selectboard, the School Board and all the taxpayers. Second, I am asking the
Westminster Selectboard to withhold that amount of money from the school budget.

Johor folk laud vape ban call

SECTION: Pg. 24

LENGTH: 447 words","


JOHOR BARU: Residents in Johor commended the Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim
Sultan Iskandar for banning e-cigarettes or vaping devices starting next year.

Mohamed Kamal Rahim, 50, said it was a wise decision to stop the habit from
taking root in Johor.

""I see undergraduates, including women, vaping in groups when they meet up in
public places. Sometimes, I feel like telling them off but I am not their
parents. I always think of vape users as people who pollute the environment, as
well as their own health,"" said Kamal.

M. Devi, 34, agreed with Kamal and urged local authorities to also check on
sundry shops and medical shops that sell alcohol and samsu.

""Sales of alcohol and samsu in sundry shops and medical shops should also be
banned, as those who are hooked on such alcoholic drinks may turn to street
crime when they need the money to get their fix.

""Vape users will become a bane to society if the culture is not nipped in the
bud and vaping devices cost as much as RM400, I was told,"" he added.

S.K. Goh, 44, also lauded the move and called for the ban to be put into effect
immediately.

However, Goh said it would be a daunting task for enforcement officers as vaping
devices could be bought online or under the counter.

""Even pirated movies, which are prohibited, can be bought in the open,"" said
Goh.

State Health and Environment Committee chairman Datuk Ayub Rahmat praised Sultan
Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar for making the call to ban the sale of vaping devices.

""Vaping brings more harm than good to society, especially among the youth, as
some users are mixing the vaping liquid with harmful substances that can be
detrimental to their health,"" said Ayub.

However, a working paper on vaping devices or e-cigarettes would have to be
prepared for the state exco meeting next month or by the first week of January,
latest.

""We need time to meet with representatives of relevant agencies. The pharmacy
unit of the Health Department will have to flush out shops that are selling the
products, which are unlicensed,"" he said.

He urged outlets selling the products to discard them immediately or return
their consignments to where they got them from or face action under the Poisons
Act 1952 or Food Act 1983.

Meanwhile, state Housing and Local Government Committee chairman Datuk Abd Latif
Bandi said checks on licences and applications will begin immediately.

""Enforcement officers from the Johor Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and
Consumerism Department will check on the shops. The operators will be fined up
to a maximum of RM2,000 for the first offence. For the second offence, we will
seize all vape products on the premises and possibly revoke the operators'
licences,"" he said.

Common terms in the fast-growing vaping subculture

SECTION: HOUSEHOLD

LENGTH: 261 words","


The subculture revolving around the use of e-cigarettes, or ""vaping"", has grown
rapidly in key markets like the United States and Malaysia, replete with a range
of unique terms.

The following are some commonly used words and phrases in the vaping world.

ADV

""All day vaping"" -- many like to vape continuously throughout the day and will
typically seek a milder flavour of e-juice -- the liquid from which inhalable
vapour is produced -- usually steering away from exotic blends.

Cloud chasing

A competition to see who can produce the largest vapour puffs. Cloud-chasers
prefer larger amounts of vapour per drag and blow rings into the air.

Coil

The metal heating element in an e-cigarette that produces vapour from e-juices.
Different designs and heating speeds can affect the strength of a drag off an
e-cigarette. Coils are usually cleaned every couple of days.

Creamy

Creamy e-juices are more redolent with non-fruit flavours such as peanut,
custard, coffee and chocolate.

PG/VG ratio

A measure of the vapour-vs-flavour balance in e-juice. It refers to the ratio of
two major ingredients, propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin. More VG produces
thicker clouds of vapour, but will dampen the flavour.

Stealth vaping

The opposite of a cloud-chaser -- stealth vapers seek smaller volumes of vapour
for more discreet vaping in settings such as the office or a restaurant.

Throat hit

Refers to the intensity of a vaping hit. A good throat hit is analogous to that
of a strong cigarette and can be affected by nicotine levels.

Vape on

An oft-uttered rallying cry for vaping enthusiasts.

New store aims to decrease smoking, increase downtown traffic in Kilgore

BYLINE: Chelsea Katz, Kilgore News Herald, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 921 words","


Nov. 30--Some people blow smoke, others blow vapor.

The vaping trend will make its way to downtown Kilgore soon with Wakie Taylor
and husband Bandy Clinton's new store, Innovapetions.

The term ""vaping"" is likely new to many in Taylor and Clinton's native Kilgore,
but it gives smokers an alternative to traditional cigarette smoking.

Although it will be a store to sell the personal vaporizers and accessories, the
main goal for Taylor and Clinton is to spread awareness and educate people about
vaping as an alternative to smoking.

""The products we sell are just a bonus to us,"" she said. ""The biggest benefit is
just you're saving lives.""

The action of smoking is there, but the only similarity to smoking is the
nicotine.

The cost of vaping is less than smoking, especially for people who might
currently smoke multiple packs a week, Taylor said.

""Compared to smoking cigarettes, you're going to save money for sure,"" she said.

Before she quit after 17 years of smoking, Taylor said she was smoking one pack
a day, and spending nearly $200 per month. With the vaporizer, Taylor said a
starter kit will probably start at about $30 -- for the vaporizer, a small
e-liquid mixture, a battery and a charger -- and it can go up from there.

Not only is vaping less expensive over time than regular cigarettes, but the
vaporizers also contain four ingredients instead of the hundreds of chemicals in
regular cigarettes, she says.

The four ingredients are combined to create an e-liquid used in the personal
vaporizers. The liquid has a foodgrade base of either propylene glycol (PG) or
vegetable glycerin (VG), which can be found in many personal care items. Some
people are allergic to PG, though, so they can have a base made completely of
VG, creating a similar base but without the allergen.

The base is then combined with three ingredients -- nicotine, water and
flavoring.

Some people will eventually find themselves 'vaping' with a mixture devoid of
nicotine. These are usually people who were light smokers before becoming vapers
or who have stepped down their nicotine intake to to a point at which they no
longer need it. The vaporizers are not cessation devices, though, Taylor said.

She emphasized, though, that she was not encouraging non-smokers to try vaping
for fun. They are promoting vaping as an alternative to smoking for people who
are currently smokers.

With many different flavors to choose from, Taylor said she will blend the
liquids in the store, so it will be whatever the customer needs.

""You're getting flavor plus the smell,"" Clinton said.

Taylor wants Innovapetions to be the go-to place for people looking to start
vaping in Kilgore. The service and advice she and Clinton got at different vape
stores when they first started was good, and she wants to continue that through
their education on vaping, she said. It can be a little complicated at first,
Taylor said.

""I will be here to help them understand how to use [their] equipment and how to
use [their] e-liquid,"" she said.

A lot of the learning is a hands-on process, Clinton said.

Taylor started vaping about a month ago, and she said she tried one of the
tobacco company's e-cigarettes. It did not have enough nicotine to curb her
cigarette craving.

It is the customization and control Taylor has with her personal vaporizer that
she likes best. She can choose the nicotine level in her vaporizer as well as
the flavor.

The e-cigarettes from the major tobacco companies do not have the customization

The flavors will vary, but she does not know what flavors they will be offering
yet.

""Everything is completely customizable,"" Clinton said.

Taylor and Clinton have gotten positive feedback from the surrounding businesses
and community, Taylor said.

Taylor plans to sell starter kits, ""mods, and everything in between.""

At first, Taylor said she will put up a curtain to divide the room in half with
only the front half open to the public. After they see the response, Taylor said
she hopes to open the back half as a sitting and lounge area with Wi-Fi and a
self-serve coffee bar.

""I'm hoping to get a lot of the college kids to come down here and stop smoking
and switch to the alternative,"" she said.

Although there are no regulations yet on who can buy personal vaporizers, Taylor
said she decided her store would not sell vaporizers izers to anyone under 18
years old. And just like when trying to buy cigarettes, customers will have to
present an I.D. to prove they are old enough to purchase a vaporizer.

""I don't want a kid coming in here, buying them just because they're cool, and
then getting hooked on nicotine,"" she said.

Taylor is working on purchasing inventory and will be setting up a website and
Facebook for Innovapetions. In addition to an online presence, Clinton said he
hopes news about the store's opening will spread through word of mouth.

Clinton, a native of Kilgore, said he would love to see downtown grow, and said
it would be great if Innovapetions tions could help the area grow.

""We want to have that warm, inviting, comforting feel when you come in,"" Taylor
said.

For more information about Innovapetions, email Taylor at
innovapetionsllc@gmail.com

The target opening date for the store is Dec. 14, and Taylor said there will be
a sitting area at the front for children as their parents look around the store
during and after the

Chamber of Commerce Com merce Snow

Hill that day.

Vaping store now open in Goshen

BYLINE: Jeff Parrott, The Elkhart Truth, Ind.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 869 words","


Oct. 15--Chad and Lisa Halle say switching from smoking cigarettes to inhaling
vaporized nicotine, known as ""vaping,"" three years ago has them feeling,
smelling and looking better while saving a lot of money.

Now they hope to help other smokers make the switch, while capitalizing on the
growing trend.

The married New Paris couple, who own ZX Gun stores in Goshen and Fort Wayne,
recently opened ZX Vape, a store at 230 S. 3rd St. in downtown Goshen. The store
sells the liquids, called ""juice,"" in an assortment of flavors and nicotine
concentrations that customers can sample. (The samples don't contain nicotine).
The store also sells an array of battery-powered devices that use heat to
vaporize the liquid into an inhalable mist.

Lisa said she quit smoking while she was pregnant with each of their four
children, but always started back up again after their births. Other smoking
cessation aids didn't work.

She said vaping offers the closest thing to smoking because it involves holding
something up to the mouth and inhaling nicotine, but without the tar from
tobacco that is so damaging to the lungs.

""It's been a really great thing that we've been able to quit (smoking with),""
she said. ""I wouldn't say it's a healthy alternative, but it's a healthier
alternative. You do still get nicotine but the great thing with e-cigarettes is
there are all different levels of nicotine.""

Lisa, formerly a half-pack-a-day smoker, said she has gradually reduced her
liquid nicotine concentration and hopes to eventually quit vaping altogether
because she knows nicotine is harmful to the circulatory system and can cause
cardiovascular problems.

To someone unfamiliar with vaping, all of the terminology and culture can seem
like another world. The devices are called ""spinners"" and ""mods,"" short for
models. Models called ""varies"" allow the user to vary the voltage of the battery
in the device. Lisa said she sets her voltage lower in the morning and gradually
turns it up later in the day to produce more of a ""throat hit,"" more closely
resembling the feel of a cigarette.

There are different types of batteries that power the devices. The level of
propylene glycol can be varied if the user has a sensitivity to it.

There's also quite a range in costs, depending on the device's intricacy. A
starter kit, containing juice, a device and charger table, starts as low as $29.

After the initial device and charger purchase, juice cost can average out to
$.65 per day, compared to $6 per day for a pack of cigarettes, Chad said.

The Halle's had been driving to a vape store in Fort Wayne for the past three
years but wanted something closer for them and their many friends who vape. They
also wanted to supply a product they say is high-quality by only purchasing from
a liquid manufacturer whose lab is certified by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.

Nationally, the rapidly growing industry has come under fire for producing
juices that are sweet and could be attractive to minors. Indiana law prohibits
the sale of e-cigarettes and liquid nicotine to anyone younger than 18. The
Halles say they will be steadfast in their refusal to sell to teens.

E-cigarettes and liquid nicotine can be found at area tobacco stores and gas
stations, but ZX Vape appears to be just the second vape-only store in Elkhart
County. In February, Julie and Andy Karnes opened The Vapor Mill at 209 S. Main
St. in downtown Nappanee.

Andy Karnes said the store is doing ""pretty well.""

""We're a new business,"" Karnes said. ""There's only so much advertising you can
do in this business. We're mainly relying on word of mouth.""

Karnes said they haven't been able to afford much radio, television and
newspaper advertising because the business is young, but they had hoped to
advertise on Facebook, which is much cheaper. They are allowed to have a
Facebook page, but Facebook has a policy that bans them from advertising because
it lumps them in with forbidden products, such as tobacco and illegal drugs.

""Even though we hate tobacco,"" Karnes said. ""At the end of the day we're trying
to sell a product that's beneficial to people. We're not targeting 14-year-old
kids who never picked up a cigarette or had any desire. I have my information in
three doctor's offices where they recommend my product to people who are trying
to quit smoking.""

Chad Halle also lamented his inability to target Facebook users with ads.
Facebook also allowed his store to have a page, but it had to be classified as a
drug store/tobacco store, even though he sells no tobacco.

Karnes and the Halles said they expect to see more vape stores open up in the
area.

""A year ago in Fort Wayne there were two stores,"" Chad said. ""Now there are 16.
I can't believe it took someone this long to put one in Goshen. They're becoming
more prevalent than cigarette stores.""

Nationally, poison control centers are reporting a dramatic rise in cases of
nicotine poisoning as children ingest or touch the liquids. The Halles said they
make it clear to customers to treat the liquid like they would medicine, keeping
it out of children's reach.

Dangers to children, teens a concern for York's smoking cessation experts

BYLINE: By MOLLIE DURKIN 505-5432/@ydhealth

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 440 words","


Regardless of the health effects, Pennsylvania's health officials want to see
age restrictions on vaping products.

In this state, there is no legal minimum age set for the sale of vaping devices.

""If a clerk doesn't care, they can legally sell a vaping pen to a 5-year-old,""
said Marie Drawbaugh, a tobacco cessation specialist for York Hospital. ""And
that's what's so concerning.""

Experts also are concerned about how accessible the devices are to teens   and
how vaping could addict them to nicotine and entice them to take up traditional
smoking.

Concerns for children: Drawbaugh said she educates her clients on how important
it is to keep vaping liquid away from small children and pets.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study shows that calls to poison
centers involving the nicotine-containing liquids rose from one per month in
September 2010 to 215 per month in February 2014.

The most common adverse health effects mentioned in the calls were vomiting,
nausea and eye irritation, the study says, and more than half of calls involved
children under 5.

""It's not a childproof cap,"" Drawbaugh said of the liquids, and the candy and
fruit flavors appeal to kids. ""And so they don't think there's anything wrong
with it.""

Young people: Vaping also could be a gateway to regular smoking, said Pam
Miller, a tobacco cessation specialist for Memorial Hospital.

""As an educator, I know that we need regulations on these to protect youth from
lifelong nicotine use,"" she said.

Another CDC study shows that more than 250,000 youth who had never smoked used a
vaping device in 2013   a threefold increase from 2011.

""They're finding that kids who've never smoked use vaping pens, get hooked on
nicotine and may go on to tobacco after that,"" Drawbaugh said. ""Are kids really
trying to be safe?""

She said a legal minimum age should be set to prevent nicotine addiction in
young people.

""We're hoping that the FDA would regulate it in the state of Pennsylvania,""
Drawbaugh said. ""And we can at least keep kids safe.""

Karen Rizzo, president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society, said the society
wants to see vaping devices regulated like cigarettes to control this
enticement.

""The bridging goes both ways, and the way it's being marketed, I think there's
more concerns about the enticement and bridging forward than the success
stories,"" she said. ""We'd like to see more people using the product to stop
smoking, versus encouraging young people to get involved in it and moving on to
regular smoking.

""Young people are seeming to like it and be drawn to it, and that's exactly what
we don't want to see.""

Bangor health board to issue statement about effects of vaping

BYLINE: Evan Belanger BDN Staff

LENGTH: 687 words","


BANGOR, Maine -- The Bangor Region Public Health Advisory Board voted Wednesday
to draft a statement regarding the health effects of vaping.


The advisory board is tasked with providing advice and guidance to the city of
Bangor, public and private health care organizations and public policy makers in
order to improve the health of the region's population.


To date, scientific research has not produced definitive findings regarding
benefits or health consequences of vaping, but the panel voted to have board
member Patty Hamilton draft a statement for consideration.


""In my mind -- and I have not yet brought this to the group -- I feel that we
ought to err on the side of the public's health,"" Hamilton, who also serves as
director of Bangor Health and Community Services, said after the meeting.


""In other words, some of the data says that it could be dangerous. Other data
says it isn't. I would rather take the chance that we put guidance in place and
that, if we find out that it's not, then we can relax that guidance,"" she said.


Voting Wednesday, the board approved the motion from member Bruce Campbell,
clinical director for the addiction treatment agency Wellspring, directing the
preparation of a statement about the health effects of vaping.


""The thing that I've not been convinced of is the long-term benefit of nicotine
addiction,"" he said. ""I get it that the smoke is not going into the lungs.""


Campbell also raised concern that vaping providers target young people ""because
as soon as someone gets addicted to the substance, the longer they're going to
have an active customer.""


Other board members raised concern that ""big tobacco"" has a stake in vaping,
that use is growing among adolescents and that some of the devices can be filled
with ""liquid marijuana"" that does not produce the same odor as regular
marijuana.


The board also heard about the conflicting nature of scientific studies on the
health effects of vaping.


""The literature is incredibly conflicting,"" said Jamie Comstock, who provides
staff support for the board and serves as program manager for Healthy Maine
Partnerships.


""For every study that says it's harmful, you can find a study that says, well,
it's kind of inconclusive at this point,"" she said.


Hamilton said she will prepare the statement for the board's consideration most
likely at its next meeting Sept. 18. The board will have the opportunity to edit
the statement and make comments before voting, she said.


The proposed statement from the board comes as the Bangor City Council prepares
to consider an ordinance that would prohibit vaping in the same places where
tobacco smoking is currently banned in the city.


The proposed ordinance would also ban vaping and smoking within 20 feet of
playgrounds and picnic areas in all city parks. Smoking is currently allowed in
city parks.


Both proposals come in the wake of a January media splash over a paper published
by the New England Journal of Medicine that said researchers detected
formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, when they tested an electronic cigarette at
higher voltages.


But one of the authors has since disputed media reports that claimed the paper
meant electronic cigarettes were more dangerous than traditional cigarettes,
saying no such statement was made by the researchers.


The paper stated that no formaldehyde was found when they tested the device at
lower voltages. The researcher still advised that users should not assume safety
when it comes to vaping.


According to a survey released in April by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, electronic cigarette use by middle and high school students
tripled from 2013 to 2014. In all, about 2 million high school students and
450,000 middle school students said they had vaped at least once in the past 30
days.


Those results come as some vaping providers accuse large tobacco companies of
pushing for increased regulation of vaping as a means to stymie competition and

Bangor health board to issue statement about effects of vaping

BANGOR, Maine -- The Bangor Region Public Health Advisory Board voted Wednesday
to draft a statement regarding the health effects of vaping.


The advisory board is tasked with providing advice and guidance to the city of
Bangor, public and private health care organizations and public policy makers in
order to improve the health of the region's population.


To date, scientific research has not produced definitive findings regarding
benefits or health consequences of vaping, but the panel voted to have board
member Patty Hamilton draft a statement for consideration.


""In my mind -- and I have not yet brought this to the group -- I feel that we
ought to err on the side of the public's health,"" Hamilton, who also serves as
director of Bangor Health and Community Services, said after the meeting.


""In other words, some of the data says that it could be dangerous. Other data
says it isn't. I would rather take the chance that we put guidance in place and
that, if we find out that it's not, then we can relax that guidance,"" she said.


Voting Wednesday, the board approved the motion from member Bruce Campbell,
clinical director for the addiction treatment agency Wellspring, directing the
preparation of a statement about the health effects of vaping.


""The thing that I've not been convinced of is the long-term benefit of nicotine
addiction,"" he said. ""I get it that the smoke is not going into the lungs.""


Campbell also raised concern that vaping providers target young people ""because
as soon as someone gets addicted to the substance, the longer they're going to
have an active customer.""


Other board members raised concern that ""big tobacco"" has a stake in vaping,
that use is growing among adolescents and that some of the devices can be filled
with ""liquid marijuana"" that does not produce the same odor as regular
marijuana.


The board also heard about the conflicting nature of scientific studies on the
health effects of vaping.


""The literature is incredibly conflicting,"" said Jamie Comstock, who provides
staff support for the board and serves as program manager for Healthy Maine
Partnerships.


""For every study that says it's harmful, you can find a study that says, well,
it's kind of inconclusive at this point,"" she said.


Hamilton said she will prepare the statement for the board's consideration most
likely at its next meeting Sept. 18. The board will have the opportunity to edit
the statement and make comments before voting, she said.


The proposed statement from the board comes as the Bangor City Council prepares
to consider an ordinance that would prohibit vaping in the same places where
tobacco smoking is currently banned in the city.


The proposed ordinance would also ban vaping and smoking within 20 feet of
playgrounds and picnic areas in all city parks. Smoking is currently allowed in
city parks.


Both proposals come in the wake of a January media splash over a paper published
by the New England Journal of Medicine that said researchers detected
formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, when they tested an electronic cigarette at
higher voltages.


But one of the authors has since disputed media reports that claimed the paper
meant electronic cigarettes were more dangerous than traditional cigarettes,
saying no such statement was made by the researchers.


The paper stated that no formaldehyde was found when they tested the device at
lower voltages. The researcher still advised that users should not assume safety
when it comes to vaping.


According to a survey released in April by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, electronic cigarette use by middle and high school students
tripled from 2013 to 2014. In all, about 2 million high school students and
450,000 middle school students said they had vaped at least once in the past 30
days.


Those results come as some vaping providers accuse large tobacco companies of
pushing for increased regulation of vaping as a means to stymie competition and
of using their own electronic cigarette brands to convince consumers the
products are more dangerous than traditional cigarettes, Reuters reports.

Opinion: Vaping is helping me kick the habit

BYLINE: Amy Persinger, Bluefield Daily Telegraph, W.Va.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 620 words","


March 15--We all know smoking cigarettes is unhealthy but now the debate over
e-cigarettes and vaping is stirring the same debate.

Should they be regulated like tobacco? Does vaping produce chemicals like
secondhand smoke does? Is vaping or using an e-cig less harmful than cigarettes?
These questions are being answered through research but the data is slow coming
in because vaping is relatively new. It is hard to find solid data from a
reliable and objective source. The lines have been drawn and the ""research"" on
vaping is coming in from both sides.

So, without picking apart the studies or claiming to be an expert I will share
what I have learned and experienced myself and through friends.

First, e-vapes and e-cigarettes are different devices with different issues, but
studies usually lump them both into one group.

E-cigarettes are small batteries with a (usually) prefilled atomizer (vaporizer)
that are designed to look and feel like an ""analogue cigarette""

Vape pens or e-vapes are a large battery -- about the size of a cigar, give or
take -- paired with a tank.

Both of these devices are filled with e-juice or e-liquid. The e-cigs usually
come prefilled whereas the tanks are refilled by the user.

The way they work is the nicotine-infused e-juice is heated quickly by the
atomizer to the point of becoming vapor rather than organic material actually
burning. This produces an inhalable vapor that delivers nicotine and flavor.
Nicotine levels vary from 3.2 milligrams, to 2.4, 1.8, 1.2, 0.6, 0.3 and all the
way down to zero. Eventually the user can be completely off the nicotine.

I have used both of these devices in attempts to quit smoking and I will say
that using an e-vape is far more satisfying than the e-cig. It feels more like
you are smoking, the flavor is better, and the health reviews seem to show the
e-cig has more issues than the vape. I've read about the e-cigs having trace
metals in the vapor.

I will weigh the pros and cons of these devices from my point of view.

Pros:

--E-vapes can be cheaper in the long run. A 10 milliliter bottle of e-juice is
about the equivalent of five packs cigarettes and costs between $6 and $12.
However, the start-up cost for gear can range from $40 to $100.

--I smoke less cigarettes. I used to smoke about a pack a day, now a pack lasts
about four days.

--I don't find myself craving a cigarette if I use the e-vape. Unfortunately, I
do still smoke them out of habit -- after meals, in the car. But if I just reach
for the vaporizer first I can avoid lighting up.

--Vaping tastes much better. With a huge variety of flavors from fruit to baked
goods to candy, and even tobacco flavors, everyone should be able to find a
flavor they like.

--Vaping doesn't leave you stinking like cigarette smoke. It doesn't stain the
walls of your house or your teeth.

--I don't have that heavy-chested feeling all the time like I used to.

Cons:

--Initial investments in the equipment can be pricey. Over time, one can amass
quite a collection of vape gear -- e-juice, replacement coils, drip tips, extra
batteries.

--Vaping has dehydrating effects. I have noticed I've had to drink far more
water (which may actually be a good thing) to prevent my throat and nasal
passages from drying out.

--Friends have reported an increase in heartburn that stopped when they stopped
using the e-vape. The two bases used for e-juice are vegetable glycerin (VG) or
propylene glycol (PG). Heartburn can be alleviated by using a higher or 100
percent VG juice.

@BT New Screen Text Drop opinion;I took my first puff of an e-cigarette last
week, and I can understand the appeal. Filled with a mint-strawberry flavoured
""juice"", the battery-powered vape pen delivered an inhalation that satisfied
much like a cigarette.

@BT New Screen/briefs Text - no indent;As a former smoker, I know. But unlike
smoking, vaping has no cancer-causing tar, and the nicotine content of the
vaping juice is optional. You can buy a vial with 3, 6 or 12 milligrams or more
of addictive nicotine â[#x20ac]"" or zero.

No tar, no nicotine â[#x20ac]"" what's the harm? Public health officials
worldwide praise e-cigs for helping smokers wean themselves from nicotine in a
form that's more familiar and satiating than gum or a patch.

But many officials changed their tune when vaping became crazy popular
â[#x20ac]"" with teens. Now, the younger and older generations are stepping a
familiar dance. We say, be careful, it could be dangerous. They say, this
belongs to us. I'll take this back if vaping is proven harmful, but for now I
say it's vital that we give young people an opportunity to define themselves and
introduce something new, rather than to automatically shut it down without
evidence.

It's easy to overreact when a craze comes on so fast. The use of e-cigs tripled
among American teens from 2013 to 2014, according to the Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention, bringing the number of middle school- and high
school-age users up to 2.4 million. Teenagers are smoking less and vaping more.

Vape supply shops have sprung up all over. There are vaping lounges,
capitalising on another, almost-forgotten pleasure of cigarette smoking; the
sociability. Vapers hold contests to blow the largest, widest or densest puff.

But the adult world of ""no"" is also moving quickly. Public health officials
caution that vaping may be a gateway to smoking. It's marketed in kid-pleasing
flavours like Kaptin Peanut Butter Crunch, blueberry and Unicorn Puke (a
""rainbow of flavours"", according to one online vendor). Noting that the juice is
unregulated and could contain God-knows-what, adults want to banish it until we
feel a sense of control. Several news outlets ran an overblown story in January
saying that at very high temperatures, vapour contains formaldehyde, a
carcinogen. For a while, the juice was thought to have an ingredient in common
with antifreeze â[#x20ac]"" that's been debunked.

The country of Wales just outlawed vaping in public places that ban tobacco use,
including pubs, restaurants and offices. The state of Nevada banned sales to
minors. And the venerable Mayo Clinic advises against vaping until we understand
the long-term health effects and dangers from second-hand vapour.

For teenagers, this adult reaction makes vaping all the more delicious.

This is our rite of passage. The Wampanoag tribe sent older boys into the woods
alone to fast. Fulani girls in West Africa tattoo their faces when they cross
into womanhood. In our society, engaging in something that frightens older
generations is one way our children tell us that they're growing up and are
making choices for themselves.

I don't think it can be as simple or painless as a child saying to a parent, I'm
going to do a few things differently now. The act must topple the miniature
mental statue a parent has of the child. It must be boys growing hair past their
shoulders or a safety pin piercing the cheek. Something so unthinkable
â[#x20ac]¦ until our kids thought to do it.

Vaping reminds us of evils we rejected, like tobacco. It's alien, so our kids
are the experts, can teach us about it and can assuage our fears. #124It's a
necessary role reversal for the people who used to exile monsters from
underneath the bed.

IN THE STATES, A GEEKY SUBCULTURE IS EMERGING AROUND E-CIGS, FROM VAPING CAFES
TO CUSTOMISED GADGETS. RUBY WARRINGTON REPORTS

It's snowing hard outside a party at the recently opened High Line hotel during
New York Fashion Week, and a gaggle of bedraggled smokers stand huddled together
against the blizzard conditions. Inside, Manhattan's most fashionable young
things are crowding round a table where another kind of smoke is available,
dispensing with the need to brave the sub-zero temperatures outside. The dry ice
on the dancefloor mixes with plumes of something that's richly scented but quick
to evaporate. Except that this isn't technically ""smoke"". Toking on slick
metallic pipes, the kids are actually blowing out clouds of flavoured vapour.
""When I started vaping at fashion week three years ago, people thought it was
gimmicky and weird,"" says Talia Eisenberg, co-founder of Manhattan's premier
""vape shop"", the Henley Vaporium. A reformed party girl, she started vaping as a
way to get off cigarettes (""my final vice""). When it worked overnight, she
realised, ""this is a game-changer. This is the future of smoking.""

In a few short years, vaping - inhaling richly flavoured, nicotine-laced
""vapour"" through a metal pipe or ""mod"" - has burgeoned into a thriving
subculture that is on the brink of going mainstream. At the Henley - part chic
SoHo cafe, part Amsterdam head shop - tattooed twentysomethings crowd the
""sampling bar"" to taste more than 120 flavours of ""e-juice"", most of them
available in five different strengths of nicotine, from zero to 24mg. ""We cater
to hardcore, pack-a-day smokers, right down to people who just like the
meditative effect of inhaling and exhaling,"" says Eisenberg.

The idea is to wean the nicotine addicts off the dirtier version of their habit
completely - and if people come to get off regular cigarettes, they often stay
for the scene. ""Let's face it, this is way cooler than a nicotine patch,"" says
Eisenberg, toting her own elegant, steam-punk-style pipe and blowing out a cloud
of vanilla-and-rhubarb-scented vapour. Originally developed using mobile-phone
technology - batteries small enough to fit in a container the shape and size of
a cigarette - vaping devices, unlike traditional e-cigarettes, come in all
shapes and sizes. The battery fits into a ""mod"" (short for modification) and is
used to heat the ""juice"" (a mixture of vegetable glycerine, propylene glycol,
distilled water, nicotine and natural or synthetic flavouring) to produce the
vapour.

""They're like man jewellery. It's an accessory, like a watch,"" says Nick, an
employee at the Henley, namechecking Atmomixani, MoJo Vapes and a man called
Pedro as some of the top names in vaping devices. ""An original Pedro 'Caravela'
will go for thousands of dollars,"" he says. One company has even commissioned
the cult rifle engraver Otto Carter to customise its pieces - ""When his hand
touches one of these mods, it goes from a $100 [£60] device to a $2,000-$3,000
piece.""

Where there are gadgets, there are geeks. Enter the enthusiasts, aka the scene's
""flavour junkies"" and ""cloud chasers"", who like to customise their mods in order
to personalise their vaping experience. ""Depending how you coil the electrical
resistant wire that's used to heat the device, you can control the flow of air.
It's a way of tailoring your vaping experience to give you the flavour and the
throat feel you want,"" says Nick, who runs customising forums at the Henley.

Rip Trippers, a man from North Dakota with a name you couldn't make up - all
hipster beard and wild eyes underneath his trucker cap - is one of the
best-known online vaping resources. His YouTube channel is dedicated to
mod-rebuilding tutorials and reviews of the latest devices, and features clips
with names like ""How vaping changed my life"". A reformed cigarette smoker
himself (he watched his two-pack-a-day father die of heart failure), he says: ""I
used to be in it for myself. I was chasing that flavour, the throat hit, the
vapour. I felt like Chuck Yeager in an X-1, pushing the envelope, chasing the
wall of sound. But then I realised this wasn't about me. I feel like God gave me
this opportunity to help keep everyone else off the cigs and bring new vapours
in.""

The vaping community isn't allowed to make any official health claims, but
devotees such as Cheryl Richter of the National Vapers Club, a consumer-run
organisation that promotes responsible legislation around vaping, says: ""The
story about how vaping has changed the lives of people who have been smoking for
20 to 30 years and thought they'd never quit is one you hear over and over
again."" The argument goes that, yes, while vaping is still addictive because
nicotine is, you get the hit without the proven carcinogens of tobacco
cigarettes. It's thought to be harmless, though we don't yet know the impact on
the lungs of inhaling propylene glycol.

Overall, vaping is a compelling sell. Richter has just opened her own vape shop
in Port Chester, in upstate New York, and there are now an estimated 3,500
""bricks and mortar"" stores in America. Meanwhile, total e-cig sales are
predicted to top $10bn (£6bn) by 2017 in the States, with some analysts
suggesting sales of vaping products could even overtake those of traditional
cigarettes by 2023.

For now, the scene is bubbling along underground, with Eisenberg likening it to
the birth of Apple computers. ""You had this bunch of nerds in a lab engineering
their own machines. In 10 years, there'll probably be one product that's the
industry standard,"" she says.

It's doubtful it will take that long. One company, Ploom, is already marketing a
vaporiser that looks as if it's straight out of the Apple studio - all sleek
lines and prepacked ""pax"" of loose-leaf tobacco (think Nespresso) in a
sophisticated white and gold box. By advertising in fashionable magazines, under
the slogan ""for the naughty and the nice"", co-founder James Monsees says he's
""targeting the sometimes smoker and the conflicted smoker. There's an
ever-growing population of people who are increasingly at odds with the idea of
smoking regular cigarettes.""

Ploom is already sold in Austria, Italy, Korea and Japan, and Monsees has what
he sees as a barely tapped market in his sights. ""There's a revolution happening
in tobacco, and that's something to embrace,"" he says.

Or as Tippers prefers to put it: ""Smoking is dead, vaping is the future, and the
future is now.""

1 Select your ""e-juice"" - the nicotinelaced, flavoured liquid that's heated to
produce the vapour. Some people mix their own flavour blends.

2 To ""vape"" (vaporise) the juice, you need a ""mod"", a battery-charged device
like an e-cig that can be modified to create extra heat and a large vapour
cloud; an ""atty"" (atomiser), the device that contains the coil to heat the
juice; and a ""vape tank"", the container for the juice.

3 Assemble the pipe, inhale and wait for the ""throat hit"".

4 Blow ""killer clouds,"" large plumes of flavoured vapour. The betterdesigned
your mod, the more impressive the clouds.

5 Want even more flavour and bigger clouds? Add a ""drip tip"" to drip juice
directly into the atty.

Parents play big role in helping kids reject vaping

BYLINE: Muhamad Solahudin Ramli

SECTION: Viewpoint; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 270 words","


VAPING has caused people to be at loggerheads with one another. To decide
whether vaping should be banned is not an easy task, while to determine how
dangerous vaping is requires research.

Regardless of the decisions and results, this new style of puffing should not be
adopted by children. It is the duty of parents to help their children say ""no""
to vaping.

Children are influenced by their environment, peers and the media. It is
difficult to make them stop a bad habit.

This is why it is important for parents and caretakers to discipline their
children when young.

Some children may be rebellious, but this should not discourage parents.

Children want freedom but parents need to remind them that they should focus on
their needs instead of their wants.

Also, there should be a limit to enjoying their freedom, for unrestrained
freedom may kill the hearts and souls of children.

Take making friends, for example.

Children may feel that friendships make life fun and sweet, but not all sweet
things are good.

Vaping may be enjoyable, but it may not be the best way to spend time, and the
health risk it poses to vapers is real.

Parents should set a good example to children.

They should not expect their children to live healthy lives when they themselves
are not doing so.

Smoking or vaping parents who preach about the consequences of such habits to
their children are like the pot calling the kettle black.

Let us practise what we preach. Reminders may sometimes fall on deaf ears, but
the action of parents will inspire and encourage children to become exemplary
individuals.

KANGAR: Perlis mufti Datuk Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin hopes more attention will
be given to the issue of bauxite mining in Pahang instead of vaping, stating
that the former posed a greater danger.

In a statement yesterday, Asri had noted the fervour in which religious scholars
and ustaz (religious teachers) discussed the issue of vaping in the mass media
as well as in a recent meeting.

He stated that when the vaping issue cropped up, the national Islamic affairs
body called all the muftis for a special meeting.

""In the mass media, religious scholars talked a lot about vaping, which was
deemed dangerous to its users. The ustaz were fervently against vaping. It is
okay.

""It is just that, how good it would be if the bauxite issue is given more

Asri said when he saw that the bauxite mining activities threatened the lives of
people, nature, plants and animals, he felt sad.

E-cigarette bans in Malaysia ignites debate

LENGTH: 861 words","

DATELINE: Malaysia


alaysia, Dec. 31 -- After Negeri Sembilan, Johor, and Kelantan states in
Malaysia, the state of Kedah is to become the latest in the country to ban the
sale of e-cigarettes or ""vapes"" in an all-encompassing crackdown on the smoking
alternative.

The ban on e-cigarettes in the Kelantan states will be effective from January 1.

The Malaysian e-cigarette market is touted as the world's second largest after
the US - worth about $125m. It is estimated that there are between 400,000 and
1.25 million vapers in Malaysia out of a smoking population of about five
million.

Websites dedicated to the sale of vape equipment and e-liquids promote their
brands on Amazon-like pages.

While some sites give details of their store addresses, others sell only online
and have no physical presence.

Vaping works by inhaling a mix of liquid nicotine with propylene glycol or
vegetable glycerine and flavourings that have been vaporised by a small battery
powered atomiser.

Timmy, who asked to be only identified by his first name, is a self-styled vape
addict and started to kick his cigarette habit.

He began his Facebook page two years ago and has a YouTube channel dedicated to
reviewing vape products to encourage people to quit regular smoking.

His Facebook site has 8,000 followers, the YouTube channel has 6,000.

He receives products from manufacturers to review, but said many items he is
sent are not up to scratch.

""Because it is still very new in the market, people are unsure whether or not
vaping is actually safe to be consumed and what the side effects are,"" he said.
Up to now the main reason for any ban has been the potential health dangers from
vaping, although medical opinion seems divided on how damaging it may be.
Certainly many vapers believe using the e-cigarette is safer than regular
cigarettes, and can be used as a way to quit smoking completely.

It is already well established that smoking cigarettes can give you cancer.
Tobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals - 43 of them known carcinogens.

But the main components - besides liquid nicotine - of vape-liquid (propylene
glycol or vegetable glycerine) are already widely and safely used in the food
industry. Much less is known, however, about how these ingredients, or the
dozens of flavours added to the e-liquid, react with the body when heated and
inhaled. Diacetyl, for example, is often used to create a buttery flavour in
popcorn, but has been linked to obstructive lung disease when inhaled.
Malaysia's Ministry of Health says it has no plan yet to ban the sale of vape,
merely regulate it. But there have been raids and seizures of goods in Johor,
southern Malaysia - raids that vape shops are now challenging in the courts as
unlawful.

The Malaysian E-vaporisers and Tobacco Alternative Association (MEVTA) has urged
retailers to continue business, as the act of ""vaping"", they say, is not
outlawed. Liquid nicotine to make up the e-liquid is legally imported from
overseas and then mixed with flavours and base liquids here. MEVTA Vice
President Ikhbal Zakaria said the appeal of vaping comes from the way it works
in giving the user the nicotine hit over other nicotine replacements such as
patches or gum.

""Smoking is habitual. One has to hold on to something, puff and blow. A
[nicotine] patch does not give you that experience. Vaping does,"" he said.

""Vaping is a personal experience. There are different designs and specifications
[of atomisers]. You can puff for flavour alone. The choices are endless.""

Part of the current debate over Vaping's safety, according to the Ministry of
Health, is that the amount of nicotine inhaled through an atomiser cannot be
accurately determined, unlike a cigarette.

Vape fans disagree. ""What is the difference between e-liquid with nicotine or
cigarettes or nicotine gum?"""" asks Zakaria.

""The Poisons Act specifies 1mg of nicotine a cigarette, so 20g a box. But one
bottle of e-liquid is 6mg."" British American Tobacco (BAT) - the makers of the
Dunhill brand - is the largest tobacco company in Malaysia.

Stefano Clini, managing director at BAT Malaysia told Al Jazeera: ""BAT is unable
to determine the impact of vaping on domestic cigarettes volumes given that the
industry is relatively new and there are no official statistics on the size and
consumption of vaping in Malaysia."" BAT is attributing its 10 percent drop in
sales this year to a combination of increases in excise duty on tobacco in 2013
and 2014, and the introduction of a new tax in April this year.

While BAT said it cannot link declining sales to larger numbers of vapers, it is
not discounting that possibility. Vape addict Timmy said he believes it is
already too late to ban vaping as it is widespread. ""If vaping gets banned then
it will go underground,"" he said.

MEVTA's Zakaria agreed. ""In Brunei and Singapore [where vaping is banned] sales
are huge."" One only has to look back to the American prohibition era to see how
successful any ban might be, according to a news agency.

Dangers of vaping are still not known

IT'S good news that Guy's and St Thomas' NHS foundation trust is banning the use
of e-cigarettes in all its wards and outside areas. Also that patients and
visitors spotted using them will be asked to stop, but will be offered
replacement therapies to help them quit. Vaping can help users of conventional
cigarettes give up smoking, but it could have serious long-term side-effects, so
we need to be cautious.

The Government and NICE should amend existing legislation on cigarettes to
include vaping to both control and limit what e-cigarettes may or may not
contain, and where they may be used.

To get people off conventional cigarettes is commendable, but vaping may well
raise new, unknown dangers to both users and those nearby (particularly passive
users visiting hospitals who might have already given up smoking and/or vaping).

Legislation should restrict manufacturers from introducing new substances to
make vaping more attractive to users until such substances are proven to be
safe.

Jury still out on how vaping affects your health Vaping Facts;
Another concern is that it will renormalize decidedly deadly cigarette smoking

BYLINE: Dr. Laurie Zawertailo University of Toronto

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. E5

LENGTH: 773 words","


There's no question e-cigarettes, also known as vaporizers, are growing in
popularity. Many people see vaporizing, or vaping, as an alternative to using
traditional cigarettes - and potentially as a tool to help people quit smoking.
Vaping is less harmful than lighting up the real thing, but there's still not
enough good evidence showing that it's harmless. The first e-cigarette was
introduced just over a decade ago. The devices are made up of three components:
a cartridge for e-liquids, which may contain nicotine and flavourings; a heating
device to generate vapour, which the user inhales; and a battery. Manufacturers
have already introduced multiple generations of e-cigarettes. The fact that the
technology is relatively new and changes quickly hampers research into the
safety of these devices and their utility as smoking cessation aids.

Originally, e-cigarettes looked just like the real thing, and had red LED lights
at the end that lit up when users took a drag. Some people even called them
""cig-alikes."" Now, they come in variety of different colours and styles and no
longer resemble their paper-rolled, tobacco filled counterparts. A new term
that's gaining popularity is Electronic Nicotine Delivery System, or ENDS.

Health Canada hasn't approved e-liquids containing any nicotine for sale in this
country, but that doesn't mean you can't buy them. Even the e-liquids that don't
contain nicotine may not be safe. Some of these ""juices"" are flavoured with
diacetyl, which is known to be toxic when ingested or inhaled in large
quantities. Determining the long-term effects of the various chemicals in
e-liquids is just one active area of study when it comes to vaping.

My research focuses on tobacco dependence and treatment, including two recent
studies involving vaping. One study looked at how effective e-cigarettes are in
alleviating cravings for traditional cigarettes. We found they were effective,
but only for a short time. The second study involved people enrolled in a free
smoking cessation treatment program involving nicotine replacement therapy and
counselling.

That research found that people using e-cigarettes during treatment were less
likely to have quit three and six months after enrolling in the program. Both
cases require further research.

Within the tobacco research and control community, vaping remains a polarizing
issue. Some of my colleagues believe vaping will spell the end of traditional
cigarettes and think the health-care community should be encouraging people to
switch to e-cigarettes. Other colleagues believe vaping will renormalize
cigarette smoking and undo the progress made through tobacco control efforts
over the last 20 years. I think that more high quality research is needed to
resolve this issue.

To further complicate matters, many tobacco companies have bought the smaller
e-cigarette companies, and are heavily promoting their battery-operated
alternatives. For tobacco companies, this has the potential not just to recoup
lost revenue from falling cigarette sales, but it may also be a new way to get
new people hooked on their products.

The number of people ""lighting up"" electronically nearly doubles each year. If
the trend continues, vaping could overtake smoking one day. As the demand for
these products grows, so does the need to find out all we can about their
benefits and risks.

Pharmacology and Toxicology. She is also a scientist in the Addictions Program

The first vaporizing e-cigarette was invented in Beijing in 2003 by a
pharmacist, Hon Lik, who hoped to quit his own smoking habit.

Imperial Tobacco, which sells its products in 160 countries, bought the patents
for Hon's invention in 2013.

Disposable vaporizers were introduced in Canada in 2007.

The World Health Organization called for a ban on the use of e-cigarettes in
public places and work places last August.

In May, Ontario passed a law banning the sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under
the age of 19, banning vaping in smoke-free areas, and regulating the promotion
and display of e-cigarettes.

In Canada, it's illegal for companies to market their vaporizers by claiming
e-cigarettes are an effective way to quit smoking or to suggest it's a safer
alternative.

More than 460 brands of vaporizers are sold worldwide.

The global market for e-cigarettes is estimated to reach a value of $3 billion
this year.

John Kelly smoked 35 cigarettes a day until he discovered ""vaping"". The Labour
senator describes the electronic device he uses as ""pen-like"", allowing him to
enjoy all the sensations of smoking but without inhaling toxins, tar and carbon
monoxide or being left with a lingering smoky smell.

""I've been a smoker all my life but in November 2012 I decided to pack in the
cigarettes and give vaping a go,"" he said. ""I use it everywhere. I'll have a
puff in a pub, before a main course arrives in a restaurant, at work, and in and
around Leinster House, and if I'm in the Seanad. I am conscious of the cameras,
so if I need a nicotine hit I'll put my head down behind the seat in front of
me, take a puff and blow [the vapour] into the ground.""

Kelly is one of an estimated 45,000 Irish smokers who have switched to
e-cigarettes and vaping devices and is unapologetic about brandishing the
product indoors even if others fume. ""One time in the Seanad, another senator
saw me vaping and took a fit with me,"" he said. ""I told her to relax, that it
was only an e-cigarette.

She apologised. But she had reacted like I was doing something totally illegal.""

Jack Gleeson, 51, editor of Dublin newspaper The Northside People, was actually
accused of acting illegally when he took out his electronic device at a Dart
station earlier this month. Gleeson, a smoker for 35 years who began vaping 18
months ago, was on his way to see Ireland play Serbia in the Aviva Stadium. ""A
security guard came over and told me I couldn't smoke,"" Gleeson said. ""I assumed
he didn't realise it wasn't a cigarette, so I showed him the device, but he said
he was serious. So I just put the device away out of politeness.""

It was the first time Gleeson, who vapes in pubs, on planes and even in cinemas,
had been challenged about using an e-cig in public. He asked Irish Rail for an
explanation the following day. ""They confirmed e-cigs are banned from all Dart
and train services,"" he said. ""They told me they were doing up posters to inform
the public, and the decision was based on complaints from people who didn't like
vaping beside them on trains.""

Vapers are furious with these regulations. Accustomed to being classed as social
pariahs when smoking tobacco, they insist e-cigarettes are not damaging anyone
in close proximity, and indeed should be encouraged as they are helping
thousands of people wean themselves off standard cigarettes. James Reilly, the
health minister, is more sceptical. He has already suggested e-cigs should only
be available through pharmacies to over-18s. Meanwhile, employers are grappling
with whether to allow vapers to light up in the workplace, while pubs and
restaurants consider their own restrictions. With no research into what effect
these products have on users, are companies such as Irish Rail right to ban
them? THE e-cigarette industry shows no sign of running out of puff, with sales
worldwide doubling in the past two years. In Britain, an estimated 1.3m of 10m
smokers have made the switch, up from 500,000 in 2012.

A typical e-cigarette has three main components: a battery, atomiser and a
cartridge containing nicotine. Nicotine is suspended in propylene glycol or
glycerine, a clear, sweet-tasting liquid often used in icing. Jason Hughes, a
professor in the University of Leicester's department of sociology, said the
e-cigarette is ""civilising"" smoking but a lack of research and the nominal link
to traditional tobacco cigarettes is not helping its reputation.

""A key development in the rise of ecigarettes includes the move away from the
straightforward mimicking of conventional cigarettes,"" Hughes said. ""Perhaps the
more significant development is the increasing involvement of the large tobacco
corporations like Reynolds American, the makers of Camel and Pall Mall, and
Altria Group, makers of Marlboro.

""E-cigarettes are a 'have your cake and eat it' device from a user's
perspective. Essentially, they provide both physical and social safety: they
won't kill me, and I can carry on smoking, even in the pub. You've a socially
acceptable form of smoking, but even that now is in danger of being outlawed
because it is guilty by association with tobacco,"" he said.

Steve Barrett, who opened Purplebox, a vaping-device shop in Temple Bar last
month, said his customers range from smokers wanting an aid to quit traditional
cigarettes to adults seeking an alternative to smoking. He finds there is still
limited knowledge of vaping among the general public. ""We are now so
indoctrinated that cigarettes cause damage that it is hard to get past the
mental block on something brought to the lips, which gives a nicotine hit and
exhales a harmless vapour. Therefore reaction is strong, and companies regard
vapers as smokers by another name in many cases,"" said Barrett.

A photograph of Leonardo DiCaprio vaping at the Golden Globes in February
sparked a debate about whether celebrities were glamorising the habit. Research
published this month by the Centre for Tobacco Control Research &Education at
the University of California said e-cigarettes are likely to be ""gateway devices
for nicotine addiction"" among teenagers. According to its data, teenagers who
use battery-powered devices are more likely to smoke traditional cigarettes. The
Irish public-health community is divided. The Irish Cancer Society and Tobacco
Free Ireland will not endorse or recommend the devices, given the lack of
research in relation to the long-term effects of e-cigs and a lack of evidence
that they assist in smoking cessation.

Yet some anti-smoking campaigners are cautiously supportive. ""Vaping is clearly
a less harmful way of getting nicotine than smoking, but nicotine is not
harmless,"" said John Crown, a consultant and senator. He does not believe vaping
should encourage smoking, except where a person is trying to quit cigarettes.

There are reasons why e-cigarettes offend. Nicotine-laced flavoured liquids in
devices can smell when released, and some models light like a normal cigarette,
giving the impression a user is smoking something combustible.

Irish Rail said it imposed its ban on e-cigarettes following ""a large amount of
feedback from customers who were not comfortable with fellow passengers using
these devices in the confined environment of a railway carriage"".

Gleeson said he could see why people could get annoyed by vaping odour, such as
coffee or strawberry flavours. ""But couldn't the same be argued for the smell of
popcorn in a cinema? Not everyone likes that, but are you going to call for a
ban? The reason why it is being banned from trains cannot be for health reasons.
There is no evidence to suggest secondhand vaping causes damage. I think it's
simply a case that it irks people to see someone puff away, or with big clouds
of vapour over their heads.""

Hughes fears that restrictions on e-cigarette use will arise due to social
pressures rather than health concerns. ""In the near future, e-cigarette use will
be tightly restricted in Europe, and perhaps banned in certain public places,""
he said. ""We may soon see further national bans, such as those already in place
in countries such as Singapore and the UAE.

""However, these bans will likely not be based on the physical dangers of vaping
but on the social dangers: that it is offensive to others; that it may
re-normalise smoking; that it may become a gateway drug; and that it is wrong
for anyone to be addicted to anything, whether there are physical dangers or
not.""

The backlash is certainly gathering pace. Vaping was banned in public places in
Los Angeles earlier this month. It looks looks like an old-fashioned smoking
ban, with e-cigarettes not allowed in parks, beaches, restaurant patios or
indoor workplaces. The rationale is that children might confuse them with
cigarettes, and think it's fine to smoke after all.

In New York, e-cigarettes were banned from public places last December. In
Europe, several countries, including Belgium, Malta, Lithuania and Slovenia
prohibit vaping wherever tobacco smoking is banned, while Italy and France
outlaw sales of e-cigs to minors. In Britain, the Wetherspoons chain of pubs,
which opens its first Irish outlet in Blackrock, Co Dublin, later this year, has
banned vaping on its premises. Each EU member state has two years to decide
whether the products should be classified as medicines and sold in pharmacies,
or as tobacco cigarettes. If they choose the latter, e-cigs will have to carry
health warnings, advertising will be restricted and nicotine concentrations
limited.

The Department of Health said it plans to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to
under-18s but ""is reviewing the evidence on the potential harm and potential
benefits"" of devices before deciding on how to regulate. In the absence of
legislation, companies such as Irish Rail are having to make up their own minds.
Dublin Bus and Bus Eireann have both confirmed e-cigarettes are now banned from
their services. Pádraig Cribben, chief executive of the Vintners' Federation of
Ireland, said pubs are free to choose their own policy. ""Our advice to members
is to have a clear policy and implement it on an evenhanded basis,"" he said.

According to smokers, ignorance is driving some of the bans. ""I was vaping in a
pub in Kilkenny when a woman told me the liquid in my e-cigarette was made out
of toenails,"" said John Paul Phelan, a Fine Gael TD who vapes in Leinster House.
""She suggested I stick to cigarettes. That shows the kind of thinking there is
on this topic among some people.""

Barrett said if smokers switched to getting their nicotine in drink form, this
animosity would not be happening. ""I would hope transport companies would enter
into discussion with vaping groups, and consider establishing vaping rooms in
bus or train stations, or categorising a carriage as a vaping carriage, for
example."" John Kelly, however, feels restrictions on vaping are a step too far.
""All this talk of regulation is the greatest load of nonsense,"" he said. ""If the
country comes down heavy handed on e-cigarettes, it will put people back on the
cigarettes.""

E-cigarette advertising triggers urge to smoke

LENGTH: 283  words","


Washington, March 13: Television advertisements for e-cigarettes may be enticing
current and even former tobacco smokers to reach for another cigarette, new
research reveals.

People who smoke tobacco cigarettes daily and who watched e-cigarette
advertisements with someone inhaling (or vaping) or holding an e-cigarette
showed a greater urge to smoke than regular smokers who did not see the vaping.

After watching e-cigarette advertisements with vaping, former smokers feel less
confident that they could refrain from smoking tobacco cigarettes than former
smokers seeing e-cigarette ads without vaping.

""We know that exposure to smoking cues such as visual depictions of cigarettes,
ashtrays, matches, lighters and smoke heightens smokers' urge to smoke a
cigarette, and decreases former smokers' confidence in their ability to refrain
from smoking a cigarette,"" said Erin K. Maloney from the University of
Pennsylvania.

The researchers studied more than 800 daily, intermittent, and former smokers
who watched e-cigarette advertising, and who then took a survey to determine
smoking urges, intentions and behaviours.

Over 35 percent of the daily smokers who were showed vaping reported having a
tobacco cigarette during the study against 22 percent of daily smokers who saw
ads without vaping, and about 23 percent of daily smokers who did not see any
advertising.

""These findings are especially relevant to ongoing health and policy
discussions, as they indicate that it is not just the health impact of
e-cigarettes and vaping themselves that must be considered,"" co-author Teresa
Thompson from University of Dayton said.

The study appeared in the journal Health Communication. (Bollywood Country

'Vaping' in schools: Berks districts scramble to stop smoke-free smoking problem

BYLINE: Holly Herman, Reading Eagle, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 988 words","


Oct. 06--Mirroring a national trend, Berks County is seeing a rise in youths
smoking e-cigarettes, a situation that alarms some educators and counselors.

Observers say the activity, known as ""vaping,"" has become more prevalent in the
last six months.

""Vaping has become trendy and attractive,"" said Jaclyn Steed, prevention program
manager at the Council on Chemical Abuse in Reading.

""People who would not normally smoke would be intrigued to try this,"" she said.

Manufacturers are using celebrities to advertise it and marketing vaping at
concerts and sporting events. They also offer the choice of 450 flavors. Steed
said flavors like cotton candy, strawberry and vanilla are popular. Cartridges
can be bought with or without nicotine.

""We are seeing young kids smoking e-cigarettes,"" she explained. ""They are not
regulated like cigarettes. Some still have nicotine in them. Nicotine is very
dangerous and it can lead to other addictions.""

Last spring, administrators at Reading's Northwest Middle School asked for
guidance because two seventh-graders were caught with the devices, Steed said.

""Our biggest concern was that the e-cigarettes were getting into the hands of
our students,"" said Northwest Middle School Principal Joel Brigel. ""The students
showed us the equipment and we notified their parents. The e-cigarettes look
like pens.""

Brigel said he contacted the COCA to come to the school to conduct education
programs on e-cigarettes and vaping.

""We saw a problem and we are trying to stay ahead of it,"" he said. ""You hear
about adults doing it, but you don't want kids to do it.""

Brigel said there have not been any incidents of vaping reported at Northwest
this school year.

Spreading the message

The incident at Northwest Middle School prompted COCA to conduct informational
sessions during summer recreation programs in Berks County, Steed said. COCA
also has added a session on e-cigarettes to an existing program it conducts in
schools about the dangers of drugs, alcohol and tobacco.

One concern, Steed said, is that there are no regulations provided by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration on e-cigarettes, as there are for traditional
cigarettes.

There are no official age restrictions to buy them, and they are easily bought
online.

The devices, which are powered by a battery, have a place to pour in liquid. A
heating element known as an atomizer turns the liquid into vapor.

""When you smoke e-cigarettes, you are putting chemicals into your body,"" Steed
explained. ""We don't know what is in it or what is in second-hand smoke. More
research needs to be done.""

Schools on the offensive

Some Berks County school districts are being proactive when it comes to
e-cigarettes and vaping.

Dr. Beverly A. Martin, Exeter's superintendent, said the district updated its
smoking policy in September to ban the devices on school property.

""We don't want our students using any tobacco or any smoking device in schools
or on school property during events,"" she said.

Martin said none of Exeter's principals have said vaping is a problem at school,
but she doesn't know if students are using e-cigarettes outside of school.

""We don't want them smoking at all,"" she said, noting that administrators can
control only what takes place on school property.

Wilson High School Principal George F. Fiore said the district has a policy that
students are not allowed to have vapor pipes or drug pipes on school property.

""Smoking e-cigarettes is mostly behavior that happens outside of school,"" he
said. ""Students know the consequences of doing things at school. Students used
to smoke cigarettes and now they are smoking e-cigarettes.""

Wilson High teacher Pete Rinella, chairman of the health and physical education
department, said the district has noticed that teenagers are using e-cigarettes.

""We are addressing it in our health classes,"" he said. ""We suspect that it's
dangerous, but there is no research on it. We know that it chemically and
physically changes the makeup of the brain.

""We have seen students using e-cigarettes. It's not attractive.""

Rinella said companies advertising e-cigarettes try to convey that they do not
contain nicotine, but some varieties do. Wilson also plans to reach out to COCA
to use its informational program, he said.

Not trying to push on kids

Store owners who carry e-cigarettes said they are careful not to sell them to
youths.

Ismael Rivera Jr., owner of Sabor Vapors, 41 S. Fourth St., Hamburg, opened his
store in June. He said customers are mostly buying e-cigarettes as a means to
quit smoking traditional cigarettes.

""There are people who come in to buy it for the taste without nicotine,"" Rivera
said. ""There are not any regulations, but we will not sell it to anyone under 18
unless they are accompanied by a guardian.""

Rivera said he expects that teens are buying e-cigarettes online or having older
people buy them.

""The vapor shops I communicate with are not selling them to people under 18,"" he
said. ""We are not trying to push them to kids. We are focused on helping people
quit smoking, not getting kids addicted to nicotine. About 93 percent of our
customers actually end up quitting. I quit. My wife quit, and most of our
customers quit.""

Prices for e-cigarette kits can range from $40 to $150, and the liquid costs $5
to $12.50, Rivera said, noting that the most popular flavor is called
razzleberry, a mix of raspberry and blueberry.

Ken Patel, owner of Route 12 Smoke Shop, Temple, said he sells three kinds of
e-cigarettes and 10 flavors.

""People use it to try to quit smoking,"" he said. ""Now you cannot smoke regular
cigarettes in some places. Customers are buying e-cigarettes so they can smoke.""

Patel said his customers are over 18.

""I won't sell any e-cigarettes to anyone under 18,"" he said.

Do new vaping laws infringe upon your charter rights?

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 704 words","


BELLEVILLE, Ont. * Just mention the phrase ""electronic cigarettes"" and
politicians at every level seem to go berserk.

""Holy non-smokes!"" they cry. ""We can't allow something new and unregulated to
exist in the marketplace! People might just solve their own problems without
us!""

From its infancy in 2003, the market for e-cigarettes has skyrocketed. It is now
estimated to be a $3.5-billion business worldwide. As someone who hates being
accosted by sidestream smoke from burning tobacco sticks, I welcome this
development. In fact, I recently spent about 90 minutes in a ""vape shop,""
meeting with several vaping entrepreneurs. Even though two or three people were
vaping nearby throughout the meeting, I experienced no discomfort. All I noticed
was a slight, pleasant, fruity aroma in the air when I walked into the shop. Had
people been consuming equivalent amounts of tobacco sticks in that space, I
wouldn't have been able to spend two minutes there without starting to cough and
gasp for air.

Indeed, scientific studies confirm that there is virtually no risk to bystanders
from second-hand vapour, unlike second-hand tobacco smoke.

The vapers I met were former tobacco smokers themselves. E-cigarettes had let
them wean themselves off tobacco. Thousands (perhaps millions) of people are
doing the same. This was more news to gladden my heart. I hate paying taxes to
support the huge medical expenses caused by tobacco-related cancers and chronic
diseases - some $14 billion in Canada in 2012. It's not primarily the nicotine
that harms smokers; it's the tar and other chemical by-products from burnt
tobacco.

Another pleasant surprise is that e-cigarettes are actually cheaper than tobacco
for vapers to get the same nicotine dose. This may be because governments impose
heavy taxes on tobacco products (about $7.3 billion per year in Canada), but
haven't yet geared up to extract similar amounts from the nicotine addicts who
have migrated to vaporizers. But for the addicts themselves, it is great news. A
disproportionate number of smokers are concentrated in the poorer segments of
society. If they can save money by substituting vaping for smoking, then they'll
have more money for other things. And if vaping helps them kick the habit
entirely, their finances will improve significantly.

But despite all these clear advantages of the vaping revolution, governments
have dug in their heels, seemingly determined to bring it to a screeching halt.
Major cities including Vancouver and Calgary have adopted bylaws discouraging
vaping. New Brunswick has had legislation hindering vaping since July 2015. And
Ontario has enacted discouraging legislation which was originally supposed to be
implemented on Jan. 1, 2016 but has been temporarily deferred.

Federally, the Standing Committee on Health issued a report in March, 2015
recommending stringent regulation of vaping.

Since 2009, Health Canada has taken the position that e-cigarettes containing
nicotine are illegal. But out on the streets, Health Canada is simply being
ignored. There's a brisk trade in vaping supplies including nicotine.

Much of the new legislation might be found unconstitutional if challenged in the
courts. Nicotine addicts who still use tobacco as a delivery method are
suffering harm to their health that now appears to be quite unnecessary. Any
government that prevents them from accessing a cost-effective harm-reduction
product is probably infringing upon their Charter right to security of the
person. That was, after all, the heart of the argument in the Insite safe drug
injection case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2011: individuals have
a right to harm-reduction.

Unlike Insite, where the government had to provide highly-regulated personnel to
supervise addicts, smokers have been switching to vaping of their own
initiative. Frequently, the entrepreneurs who guide them are empathetic
fellow-travellers, despite being profit-seeking businesses. Vapers are looking
after their own well-being and promoting the well-being of others into the
bargain.

And the free market - much reviled among nanny state politicos - is making it
all possible.

Vaping association to cooperate with government

SECTION: Pg. 3

LENGTH: 248 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: The country's first ""vaping"" association is extending its
cooperation to the government to regulate vaping.

Malaysia E-Vaporisers and Tobacco Alternative Association (Mevta) president
Allan Foo said the government could come up with standards, rules and
regulations.

In an industry that involves five different players, Foo suggested that the
government gain insight from producers, exporters, importers, retailers and
consumers, among others.

""On our (Mevta) part, we are willing to share and provide information. Since
vaping has come into the picture, the tobacco industry has been affected.

""We are willing to talk to the government on whether vaping should be subjected
to tax and its implementation,"" Foo said, adding that government agencies, such
as Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (Sirim) were welcomed
to participate.

Sirim, said Foo, could assist by testing the hardware, computer chips and the
liquids used.

""Getting the right benchmark will give vaping proper regulation. We can also
follow British standards as they are ahead of us in this.""

Although there are no official figures, Mevta estimates there are between
500,000 and 800,000 users in the country.

""We believe vapers make up for slightly more than 10 per cent of smokers, which
is between four million and five million.

""That is 30 per cent of the total number of smokers. If the figure is accurate,
the tobacco industry would have been hit badly and that is the last thing we
want.""

G2: Shortcuts: Linguistics: Why 'vaping' is a disaster for smokers

BYLINE: Stuart Heritage

SECTION: GUARDIAN FEATURES PAGES; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 339 words","


E-cigarette maker Gamucci is opening the world's first airport ""vaping zone"" in
the Terminal 4 international departure lounge at Heathrow today.

If the zone is a success, it'll be seen as a huge victory for the burgeoning
e-cigarette industry. But with a name like that it doesn't stand a chance.
Vaping zone. Say it out loud. You can't, can you? Someone might be listening,
and they'd probably punch you right in your stupid face if they heard you.

Is this what we're supposed to call the act of smoking an

electronic cigarette? Vaping? Are e-smokers vapists? Because vaping sounds
worryingly like a form of sexual assault, or a bewilderingly ill-advised 1980s
dance craze. Smokers must be furious. E-cigarettes were their big chance to
become socially acceptable again, but whoever came up with ""vaping"" has ruined
it. What's worse: going outside to smoke, or sitting indoors to vap off?

And, just like actual smoking - hot smoking, as the vapists call it - all sorts
of neologisms are bound to spring up around e-cigarettes. What's the vaping
equivalent of smirting (smoking and flirting), for example? Is it varting? And
what are we to call cigaretiquette (the generalised behaviour surrounding
smoking) in the age of e-cigarettes? Vaprotocol? That sounds like a cheap brand
of bronchitis medication.

The website Ecigology (itself a terrible word that deserves to be bludgeoned to
death) has a glossary teeming with ridiculous new words and phrases. It's a
world of ""carts"" and ""cartos"" that you

fill with ""smoke juice"" and

accessorise with ""a drip tip"", being careful not to ""flood your atty"". Imagine
being the sort of person who actually talks like this. It'd be like living your
entire life inside an Australian remake of A Clockwork Orange directed by Chris
Morris.

Forget bold-print health warnings and close-up pictures of diseased lungs,
nothing's going to repel you from a packet of cigarettes - electronic or
otherwise - like knowing that you'll have to stand in something as ridiculous as
a vaping zone to smoke them.

Washington: Norton Introduces Bill to Ban Use of E-Cigarettes and Other
Electronic Smoking Devices on Airplanes

LENGTH: 1131  words","

DATELINE: Lahore



    Washington: Office of the MP Eleanor Holmes Norton has issued the following
news release:



 Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), a senior member of the House
Aviation Subcommittee, today introduced a bill to prohibit the use of electronic
cigarettes and vaping devices on board airplanes following the U.S. Department
of Transportation (DOT) rule issued yesterday prohibiting passengers and
crewmembers from carrying battery-powered portable electronic smoking devices in
checked baggage, which did not ban the use of these vaping devices on airplanes.
Norton said these devices pose significant fire and health risks to airplane
passengers, and that she acted because the DOT rule requiring passengers to
carry electronic vaping devices onto airplanes is a &ldquo;virtual
invitation&rdquo; to smoke, making this bill necessary.  Norton said although
some individual airlines have banned the use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices
on airplanes, a federal ban is necessary to cover all airlines.


    &ldquo;The use of e-cigarettes and similar vaping devices on airplanes
presents a substantial safety risk to passengers from second hand smoke as
leading medical organizations have warned,&rdquo; Norton said.  &ldquo;The
Department of Transportation rule issued yesterday prevents passengers from
putting vaping devices into checked luggage, yet, under current federal law,
passengers on certain flights can smoke using devices that have not been shown
to be definitely safe, either for the user or those around them.  Individual
airlines have already recognized the risks posed by vaping devices, and it is
time we made the ban on using them in-flight universal with a congressional
bill.&rdquo;Ms. Norton.  Mr. Speaker,



 I rise to introduce the Banning the Use of Electronic Cigarettes on Airplanes
Act of 2015.  The bill prohibits the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping
devices on commercial airplanes by including use of these devices within the
definition of smoking.  Smoking tobacco products on commercial airplanes has
been banned for years, but with the increase in use of electronic cigarettes and
vaping devices in their place, it is necessary to update our laws to reflect
this new nuisance and health risk on airplanes.  The Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in 2011 ban
the use of these devices, but four years later, no progress has been made.
Therefore, Congress should step in to legislatively resolve the issue.



 Electronic cigarette use has increased over the last decade with the increased
education of the general public about the dangers and public health threats
caused by traditional cigarettes to smokers and nonsmokers alike.  For example,
between 2010 and 2011, e-cigarette use among adults doubled.  Researchers and
public health experts have voiced concerns over the use of electronic cigarettes
because there are still so many unknowns about the chemicals these devices can
produce.  The American Lung Association (ALA) has cited many concerns about the
lack of regulation of e-cigarettes because they are on the market while the
potential harm from secondhand e-cigarette emissions is unknown.  ALA has
identified two studies that show formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene,
tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and other harmful irritants coming from
e-cigarette emissions.  In addition, the temperature of an e-cigarette can
affect how many harmful the chemicals are, but with no configuration standards,
it is too difficult to uniformly assess the health effects of smoking
e-cigarettes.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a proposed rule in
2014 that would extend new regulatory authority to e-cigarettes by subjecting
e-cigarettes to registration and product listing requirements, restrictions on
marketing products prior to FDA review, and a prohibition on providing free
samples like with traditional tobacco products.



 This year we celebrate 25 years since legislation was passed banning smoking on
domestic flights in the United States.  In the 1960s, the U.S. Surgeon General
identified smoking as a cause of increased mortality and by 1986, the U.S.
Surgeon General had named secondhand smoke a serious health risk.  The National
Academy of Sciences, in its report &ldquo;The Airliner Cabin Environment:  Air
Quality and Safety,&rdquo; recommended a ban on smoking on all domestic
commercial flights.  The Association of Flight Attendants can be credited with
urging the smoking ban due to the negative health impacts flights attendants
suffered working in cramped, closed-off spaces when a third or more passengers
smoked in-flight.  Congress used this information to include an amendment
authored by then-Representative Dick Durbin (D-IL) in the Federal Aviation Act
that made domestic flights of two hours or less smoke free.  By 1990, this
smoking ban was extended to all domestic flights of six hours or less, and, in
2000, the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act made all flights to
and from the United States smoke-free.  All of this was done even in the face of
the strong tobacco industry&rsquo;s opposition because of the undeniable health
impacts of cigarettes and cigarette smoke.  Many flyers do not remember a time
without &ldquo;No Smoking&rdquo; signs located throughout a commercial airplane.




 In 2011, the U.S. Department of Transportation issued its NPRM to prohibit the
use of e-cigarettes on U.S. airplanes.  Under current FAA policy,
battery-powered electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, vape pens, atomizers, and
electronic nicotine systems are prohibited in checked baggage, and the FAA
recommends that such devices only be carried in the aircraft cabins because of
safety issues.  It is up to individual airlines to ban their use.  Some airlines
have already taken the initiative to institute a ban on the use of electronic
cigarettes, but legislation is necessary to make this update applicable to all
airlines, and permanent.



 The current smoking ban applies to the smoking of tobacco products on all
scheduled passenger flights and on scheduled passenger flight segments on
foreign air carriers in the U.S. and between the U.S. and foreign countries,
unless a waiver is granted based on bilateral negotiations.  The Banning the Use
of Electronic Cigarettes on Airplanes Act of 2015 will amend the statutory
definition of smoking located in 49 U.S.C. 41706 to include the use of
electronic cigarettes, defined as &ldquo;a device that delivers nicotine or
other substances to a user of the device in the form of a vapor that is inhaled
to simulate the experience of smoking.&rdquo;



 I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

Vaping poses a challenge to tobacco industry

BYLINE: Mokhriz Mokhtar

LENGTH: 412 words","


The tobacco industry, which for decades has been able to fend off threats of
other smoking alternatives, is facing a real challenge from vaping as consumers
shift to the trendy e-cigarette over traditional smoking.

Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) in a report said vaping has become a
phenomenon and it is gaining traction among Malaysians.

""It is estimated that there are approximately 400,690 adult vapers in Malaysia,""
HLIB said based on Bank Negara Malaysia statistics and World Health Organisation
survey estimates.

Based on this figure, vapers account for 8.7% of the 4.6 million smokers in
Malaysia, HLIB said.

""In the absence of a concrete regulatory stance, we believe that the vaping
industry would continue to flourish,"" said HLIB.

The research firm said Euromonitor International Ltd estimated that the world's
vaping industry is valued at US$6 billion (RM25.2 billion) with about 13 million
users in 2014.

""It is negative to the industry's (tobacco companies) total volume. Those
switching to vape are a lost to the tobacco industry,"" HLIB said in the report.

HLIB expects the global vaping industry to increase to US$23.4 billion in 2019
and US$50 billion by 2030 in the absence of tariffs like taxation imposed on the
tobacco industry.

""The figure represents a compound annual growth rate of 29.3% to 2019,"" HLIB
said, adding that the growth has been propelled by advertising and promotion
through the Internet and social media platforms.

The Malaysian Reserve last month reported that more tobacco smokers are
switching to vaping as a way to quit smoking besides jumping on the vape
bandwagon as a lifestyle choice.

Malaysia is also one of the leading vape markets with 30% of China's vape
products are destined for Malaysia.

Although the vape threat to tobacco companies are real, HLIB maintained a 'Hold'
rating on British American Tobacco (M) Bhd (BAT) with a target price of RM65.54.

""Our analysis thus far has indicated that the presence of vaping does pose a
threat to the traditional tobacco industry.

""BAT being the largest tobacco player in Malaysia (with about 60% market share),
is not immune to this.

""With volumes dwindling and BAT still partially absorbing the Goods and Services
Tax, its financial year 2015 prospects remain challenging.

""The saving grace for BAT comes from its defensive earnings, dominance in an

Vaping an addict's lesser of two evils

'Un-Islamic' vaping catches fire in Malaysia amid govt backlash

SECTION: CONSUMER TRENDS

LENGTH: 757 words","


At Malaysian e-cigarette outlet Vape Empire, customers kick back and puff out
thick, aromatic clouds of vapour in funky flavours like Horny Mango and Creamy
Suckerz' Banana Anna.

""Vaping"" is soaring in popularity in Malaysia, the largest e-cigarette market in
the Asia-Pacific region, but authorities are threatening to ban the habit for
health reasons -- a move that has sparked anger from growing legions of
aficionados.

Backing a ban, Malaysian religious leaders this month declared a fatwa on the
""un-Islamic"" habit, but it remains to be seen whether the decree will dampen
enthusiasm.

""The business is growing very fast because there are many people trying to
convert from tobacco smoking to vaping,"" Vape Empire's co-founder Muhammad
Sharifuddin Esa said, adding that his business has expanded to 57 locations
since it opened just two years ago.

The pastime has proved a particular hit in the moderate, Muslim-majority nation,
where other vices such as alcohol and drugs are especially frowned upon.

Now several Malaysian states say they may impose a ban from January 1 and have
threatened to stop issuing new merchants' licences -- a potential blow to a
sector worth an estimated 2.8 billion ringgit ($650 million) last year,
according to reports.

- Health risks debated -

The industry, which is expected to grow by more than 13 percent year-on-year to
2025, is currently unregulated, and many say forbidding e-cigarettes -- already
outlawed in Thailand and Singapore for health reasons -- is a big mistake.

""The government must regulate and not ban, because vaping is the future,""
Sharifuddin said.

Research on health risks remains split and like Malaysia, few countries have
introduced national legislation to regulate the sector.

The devices function by heating flavoured nicotine liquid -- or e-juice -- into
a vapour that is inhaled, much like traditional cigarettes but without the
smoke.

Some experts warn vaping can produce cancer-causing formaldehyde and one US
study said vaping is up to 15 times more harmful than traditional tobacco
smoking. The World Health Organization has called on governments to ban the sale
of e-cigarettes to minors.

But other research suggests vaping is safer than smoking cigarettes and
manufacturers tout them as harmless aids to quit tobacco.

Enthusiasts in Malaysia say banning the habit doesn't make economic sense.

""Vaping communities are fighting for their rights because the vape scene
actually brings profits to the country,"" said Muhammad Imman, marketing manager
of the colourfully named Fcuking Flava vape shop, one of thousands that have
popped up across the country.

Marketers cater to local tastes, selling e-juice flavoured with snake fruit,
lychee and even durian, the notoriously pungent Southeast Asian fruit.

The juices are marketed like single-malt whiskies or perfumes, as seen at a
recent vaping convention in Kuala Lumpur, their creators extolling organic and
other premium ingredients.

Aficionados gather daily in Malaysia's vape shops, sometimes for ""cloud chasing""
competitions to see who can produce the biggest vapour puffs and to show off
vape prowess by blowing rings into the foggy air.

- DIY e-juice -

Some agree there is a greater need for quality control to keep dodgy DIY e-juice
from entering the market and to ensure e-cigarette devices aren't used for
smoking drugs like marijuana.

A growing number of amateur merchants have emerged across the country, where
about a million people smoke e-cigarettes, a five-fold surge since last year,
according to the Malaysia E-Vaporizers and Tobacco Alternative Association
(MEVTA) activist group.

Making e-juice is a simple process that involves mixing readily available
ingredients -- water, flavouring, nicotine and other easy-to-access chemical
compounds.

On a Kuala Lumpur street recently, a vendor set up a table arrayed with a range
of flavours, from guava to lychee on sale for about 30 ringgit ($7).

""Mine are the best,"" he boasted to passing office workers.

But some bottles looked old and reused, and he was tight-lipped on the e-juice's
origin.

Other more mainstream Malaysian manufacturers have struck deals to distribute
their goods elsewhere in Asia and as far afield as Europe, as Malaysian flavours
become popular overseas.

The habit doesn't appear to be losing steam at home, especially among former
smokers.

""I actually have reduced the level of nicotine when I vape,"" said officer worker
Nicolas Chan, speaking between puffs on his lunch break.

""I feel better and have more energy after quitting cigarettes and starting to
vape.""

OPINION & ANALYSIS

LENGTH: 620 words","


A FEW weeks ago I was out at a picnic when a smoking friend pulled out a strange
device and began puffing away. Seeing my perplexed look, she told me she wasn't
smoking, she was ""vaping"", and that the electronic cigarette she held in her
hand had finally weaned her off cigarettes.

She'd tried all of the usual ways of giving up and none had worked, but since
buying her vaping kit online, she had thrown the cigarettes to the four winds.

I must say I felt a bit strange about the whole affair. As a former smoker, I
know the lure of tobacco only too well, and I sympathise with anyone trying to
stop. It's not the nicotine that causes health problems in smoking, it's various
other chemicals, many of them created by the burning of the cigarette itself.

But the whole idea of a plastic, electrically charged device making mail-order
steam looked a bit too out-there for me.

But if vaping had the potential to accelerate the already steep decline in
Australian smoking rates, that could only be a good thing, couldn't it? Or not.

As I watched the nicotine steam pour out of her mouth and nostrils, I couldn't
help but wonder if there was something slightly hypocritical about proclaiming
to have given up smoking, while at the same time sucking in lungfuls of nicotine
in a vapour of unknown chemical composition.

But I have to confess that what surprised me more than anything was that vaping
existed at all, and that I knew absolutely nothing about it.

My friend was the first person I had seen, to my knowledge, anyway, vaping in
public, and I would have thought that something as potentially polarising as
vaping would have fomented a bit of public debate.

Well it might not have here yet, but it has in America, the spiritual home of
weird inventions like this.

And when I went online - where Australian vapers must apparently go to buy their
paraphernalia - I was reminded once again that the internet is a whole new
world.

I googled ""vaping"", and the first things that came up were a series of columns -
a bit like this one, really - debating the pros and cons of vaping.

A few clicks later as I shifted through some of the pictorial images, and I
found myself watching a young Aussie woman, who was running various blogs and a
YouTube page, in which she expounded the virtues of various types of vaping
equipment.

After asking a few people closer to the digital world than me, I was told that
pages such as these are usually paid for by the equipment sellers, who kit up
willing participants to put out online spiels that are little more than
undisclosed ads.

You would never get away with this in mainstream media. Remember the hullabaloo
- and rightly so - over the ""cash for comment"" scandal with John Laws and Alan
Jones?

There are no such rules out there in Internet World.

And as I watched this young woman vape a blue liquid called ""Northern Lights"", I
got the horrible feeling that vaping might be less of a healthy alternative to
smoking than a new slo-mo health problem in the making.

My friend insists that the liquid nicotine she imports is safe and free from
nasties, but most apparently use some form of anti-freeze in their mixtures,
although the propylene glycol apparently used in most is described as
""non-toxic"". Well it is on Wikipedia, anyway.

A recent Economist article estimated that e-cigarettes had less than 1 per cent
of the smoking market but tobacco companies have already started buying up the
e-cig makers.

I could find little evidence that Canberra or any of the state governments were
turning their attentions to vaping, but the US Food and Drug Administration is
keeping a close eye on developments.

After all, where there's smoke, there's usually fire. Or in this case, nicotine
steam. And antifreeze.

Santayana's famous definition of fanaticism -- redoubling your efforts while
losing sight of your goal -- never might have been more applicable than it is to
the backlash against vaping.

Vaping, in case you're unfamiliar with it, is the use of electronic cigarettes,
which employ water vapor rather than tobacco smoke to deliver nicotine. Although
vaping is not as healthful as an hour of vigorous exercise, it is vastly better
for you than smoking.

Yet rather than welcome the trend, some health advocates have tried to restrict
it, on the grounds that it could be a ""gateway"" to tobacco use, especially for
young people. Put those fears to rest. As Michael Siegel, a professor of public
health at Boston University, explained recently in The Wall Street Journal, the
gateway-drug knock against vaping is a myth.

Two recent studies have examined the question. In essence, they found that 99
percent of vapers are tobacco addicts seeking a healthier alternative, or an
off-ramp leading to complete nicotine independence. Only 1 percent of vapers are
nicotine non-users who took up the vaping habit. What about nonsmokers who then
switched from vaping to tobacco use? Statistically speaking, they are roughly as
common as tap-dancing unicorns.

This is great news. It means society has found a technology that can get smokers
to kick the tobacco habit without any known side effects or unintended
consequences.

Of course, this is also bad news for public-health advocates who opposed vaping.
They will now have to find something else to be against.

Health minister urges caution over push for provincial vaping ban

SECTION: CITY &; REGION; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 440 words","


Health Minister Dustin Duncan says that adding vaping to the province's tobacco
legislation probably won't have the effect municipalities are seeking.

On Tuesday, delegates at the Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association
(SUMA) convention voted in favour of advocating that the Ministry of Health ban
vaping in the same public places in which you are not allowed to smoke: Enclosed
public areas, cars with passengers under the age of 16; near the doorways,
windows and air intakes of public buildings; and school grounds.

SUMA president Debra Button said the drive behind the resolution was the
""fragmented"" rules across the province as municipalities implement their own
anti-vaping bylaws. Button said provincial legislation would provide
consistency. But Duncan said Wednesday, ""I'm not sure that any measure by the
province really necessarily removes that patchwork,"" seeing as municipalities
would still be able to create bylaws on top of those regulations.

He said he is also ""cautious"" about adding vaping to provincial legislation, as
its health effects are still unknown and he doesn't want to deter people using
it as a smoking cessation tool.

The minister noted the close vote, saying, ""There is still, I think, a lot of
division even within the municipal sector in terms of how far we want to
proceed.""

Regina Mayor Michael Fougere supported the resolution, making the patchwork
argument, expressing concerns over the unknown effects of vaping, and
emphasizing

that health is a provincial matter.

He said the ""province has downloaded issues to us in the past. They could quite
easily make regulatory changes for the entire province,"" calling it the ""most
expeditious and fair and reasonable way to do it, in our view.""

But Duncan doesn't ""necessarily see it as downloading onto the municipal
sector.""

He said the bylaws that communities have passed on this issue ""show that
municipalities are independent. They can make these decisions on their own. If
they feel like they want to go stronger than what the provincial government (has
legislated), they have that ability and some have already done that.""

A vaping ban was one of a number of health-related issues that came up at the
SUMA convention ""bear pit"" Wednesday, where local officials had the opportunity
to lob questions at provincial ministers. People also asked about perceived cuts
to health care and health sector waste, and shortages of health care
professionals.

Infrastructure funding was a hot topic, too, as well as changes to conflict of
interest legislation. nlypny@postmedia.com twitter.com/wordpuddle !@COPYRIGHT=©

Jonathan Brower is the owner of Waldo Vapes in Kansas City, Mo., which sells
some high-end vaping products.

A vast selection of flavors are available for testing at Vapor World, a store in
Lenexa, Kan., specializing in everything vapor.

KANSAS CITY - Like many a hard-core smoker, Candi Mc-Cann found it a bear to
quit. Nothing worked. Not the patch. Not those blue smoking cessation pills her
doctor prescribed.

Then she tried those electronic cigarettes that produce a steamy vapor instead
of smoke. Click, just like that, she went from more than a pack of smokes a day
to becoming the Kansas City area's leading vaping evangelist.

Finally shed of her 21-year smoking habit, the 42-year-old McCann now preaches
about the latest vaping gear on her YouTube channel. She helps organize ""vape
meets"" of fellow enthusiasts through the Fountain City Vapor Club. And more
recently she has turned her passion into a full-time job, hiring on as manager
at the Vapor World store near her home in Lenexa, Kansas.

""April 9, 2012, that's my vape-versery,"" she said, taking a drag from a
mouthpiece sticking out of a boxy contraption in her palm that was about the
size of an eyeglass case.

""I'm not going to tell you this is healthy,"" said McCann. ""But I can tell you
that it is 99 percent better for you than smoking.""

Whether that stat is true or not, that's one selling point that keeps customers
coming back to the more than three dozen vape shops that have set up in the
metro area since 2013. Before, there were few or none.

Then there's the social aspect that has seen some vaping stores, like Waldo
Vapes, becoming something akin to java-free coffee shops, where people gather to
shoot the breeze, play games and challenge each other to see who can blow out
the biggest cloud of scented vapor.

""It's becoming a community,"" Levi Fields, a 20-year-old student at the culinary
school at Johnson County Community College, said as he took a toke in Waldo
Vapes' living-room-like setting. ""It's getting really, really big.""

Supporters see e-cigarettes as a godsend for people trying to reduce or quit
smoking, which kills 480,000 Americans a year, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

But the trend concerns some health advocates. Scientists don't yet know much
about the health effects of electronic cigarettes, which are largely unregulated
and the subject of competing claims.

Critics also contend vaping is trading one form of addiction for another and
that the safer-than-cigarettes claims are convincing teens to adopt a nicotine
habit they might not have otherwise.

""It is a way to get kids addicted to nicotine,"" said Sue Matson, substance abuse
prevention coordinator at the Johnson County Mental Health Department. ""I'm
concerned about the possibility of renormalizing behavior that we have spent a
long time getting away from.""

As the federal Food and Drug Administration weighs those arguments in advance of
imposing greater regulatory control, there is no debating this: Vaping has gone
mainstream in the last couple of years, spawning a more than $3 billion-a-year
industry in the United States. Two-thirds of sales are online, but increasingly
there are brick-and-mortar stores like the dozens of outlets that have been
cropping up across the nation.

Open systems allow users to customize their vaping experience.

They can choose among a wide array of flavored liquids - from
bubble-gum-flavored to hazelnut butter cream - each of which has various levels
of nicotine to none at all. Drops of that ""e-juice"" are dripped into
battery-powered gadgets that look nothing like cigarettes.

They range from rechargeable vaping pens, called that because they look like
writing instruments and cost about $25 for a starter kit, to so-called modified
systems. Mods, for short, are built from mix-and-match components that can cost
as little as $40 to as much as a few hundred dollars. The price goes up along
with the wattage options. The more power, the more vapor.

Customers range in motivation, too. Some stop in only when they need to feed
their nicotine habit.

""They buy their juice coils once a week and go about their day,"" McCann said.

But there is also a dedicated bunch who consider themselves hobbyists. They
enjoy sampling different flavors and buying better and more expensive vaping
equipment.

And yet as big as vaping has become in a short amount of time, it's far from
being widely accepted outside the subculture that has grown up around it.

Which is why shop owners like Jonathan Brower, owner of Waldo Vapes, are wary of
and bracing for new rules that are sure to come down the pike eventually.

""People have a hard time wrapping their head around the fact that we're not
smoking anything,"" he said.

There may not be smoke, but local, state and federal officials are fired up
about the need to regulate e-cigarettes.

Overland Park and Columbia, for example, are among a number of local communities
that have extended prohibitions already imposed on smoking to vaping. It's not
allowed in indoor public spaces, confounding smokers who had been vaping in bars
rather than stepping outside to light up.

Also, both Missouri and Kansas are among the states that forbid the sale of
e-cigarettes and vaping gear to minors, a restriction that local vaping store
operators welcome.

""The main thing we're fighting now is we're getting a lot of minors trying to
buy,"" said Aaron Todd, who owns the Vapur of KC store and is part owner of two
other Vapur stores in the area. ""I even had one kid come in with his dad, point
out what he wanted and slide his dad a $20 bill, and I wouldn't sell it to him.""

More than anything, it's that concern for minors that is driving opposition
locally and nationally.

A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the
use of e-cigarettes by teenagers had risen sharply, with 13 percent of high
schoolers reportedly using them in 2014. At the same time, though, the number of
high school smokers had dropped from 16 percent in 2011 to 9 percent in 2014.

""They (teenagers) believe it's a safe alternative because that's what they are
being told,"" said Kevin Kufeldt, who runs a regional drug treatment center that
serves adolescents from across Kansas.

To dissuade teens and their parents from vaping, Tri-County Mental Health
Services in the Northland plans to begin sending out public service
announcements through social media this summer.

The theme, said Tri-County's Reshana Peterson, is ""about the fact that nicotine
is nicotine.""

Many adults, she said, believe they are doing their teens a favor by allowing
them to vape, rather than smoke, when the better alternative is to do neither.

Some school districts have changed their regulations recently to prohibit all
nicotine products, rather than just tobacco, because of the trend, Peterson
said.

Another area where regulation is coming involves the products themselves. No
quality control standards apply. While manufacturers and shop owners say the
industry's products are safe, vaping juices are not tested or regulated. At
least one study found that some liquids said to contain no nicotine did, in
fact, have nicotine in them.

""You can put whatever you want on a label,"" Kufeldt said. ""It doesn't mean it's
true.""

Many in the industry wouldn't mind the FDA getting involved for that very
reason. One of the biggest impediments to further growth in the category is the
loss of consumer confidence in the vapor people are breathing in place of
tobacco smoke.

McCann would be sad if regulation damaged what she considers to be an industry
that has helped a lot of people like her cut back on or quit cigarettes
entirely.

""It meets my need,"" she said. ""I don't smell like smoke anymore. I don't get
bronchitis anymore.""

And she'd miss the folks she's met at vape meets, where there's always a bit of
horse trading amid the vapor rings and billowing clouds of mist. ""We swap juices
and show off our mods,"" she said.

And surely, she said, there's no harm in that.

If we ban vaping, we should do the same for smoking

BYLINE: Lionel Perera

SECTION: Viewpoint; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 418 words","


SINCE the dawn of time, man has had this obsession with smoking.

In the late 1970s, Herbert Gilbert invented the first smokeless non-tobacco
cigarette.

His idea was to replace burning paper and tobacco with flavoured steam, or
vapour, that contained nicotine.

It wasn't until 2003 that this product hit the market, thanks to Hon Lik from
China who marketed the product.

The jury is out on whether vaping is safe. However, most agree that it is a
healthier alternative to cigarettes.

Let us consider the differences between vape and cigarettes.

One main factor is tar. There is none present in vapour.

Smoking, however, produces a toxic byproduct.

If you blow cigarette smoke on a napkin, it will turn yellow instantly. However,
with vaping, it will remain white. This gives us an idea as to what tar is doing
to our lungs.

A pack of cigarettes costs almost RM20. If you smoke a pack a day for a week, it
would cost you RM140 a week or RM560 a month.

The price of vape juice varies greatly but RM20 will buy you a bottle that can
last from three days to a couple of weeks, depending on how often you vape.

Most of my friends said that they had saved close to RM150 a month since they
switched to vaping.

We do not know the effects of vaping over a long period as there have not been
any long-term studies done to show its effects.

But the most controversial ingredient in cigarettes is nicotine, which is
addictive.

For that reason, many juices are available without nicotine.

All cigarettes have nicotine. Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,000
chemicals, including 43 cancer-causing (carcinogenic) compounds and 400 toxins.
These include carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic
and DDT.

A recent article in a study showed the formation of formaldehyde in e-liquids at
high temperatures.

This study has been debunked. The major argument being that vapers would never
need to reach those dangerous temperatures to enjoy vaping.

In other words, nobody would be able to endure the taste in the conditions set
forth in the experiment. Interestingly enough, even when used properly,
cigarettes still contain formaldehyde.

Despite the overwhelming evidence, vaping is neither safe nor healthy.

But, relatively speaking, vaping is a safer alternative to smoking. I stopped
smoking because it was bad for my wallet.

It's good that the sultan of Johor had called for a ban on the sale of vape
products in the state. It's high time that cigarettes are also banned.

Vaping, the smoking solution politicians hate; E-cigs market skyrocketed, writes
Karen Selick

Just mention the phrase ""electronic cigarettes"" and politicians at every level
seem to go berserk. ""Holy non-smokes!"" they cry. ""We can't allow something new
and unregulated to exist in the marketplace! People might just solve their own
problems without us!"" From its infancy in 2003, the market for e-cigarettes has
skyrocketed. It is now estimated to be a $3.5 billion dollar business worldwide.
As someone who hates being accosted by sidestream smoke from burning tobacco
sticks, I welcome this development. In fact, I recently spent about 90 minutes
in a ""vape shop,"" meeting with several vaping entrepreneurs. Even though two or
three people were vaping nearby throughout the meeting, I experienced no
discomfort. All I noticed was a slight, pleasant, fruity aroma in the air when I
walked into the shop. Had people been consuming equivalent amounts of tobacco
sticks in that space, I wouldn't have been able to spend two minutes there
without starting to cough and gasp for air.

Indeed, scientific studies confirm that there is virtually no risk to bystanders
from secondhand vapour, unlike second-hand tobacco smoke.

The vapers I met were former tobacco smokers themselves. E-cigarettes had let
them wean themselves offtobacco. Thousands (perhaps millions) of people are
doing the same. This was more news to gladden my heart. I hate paying taxes to
support the huge medical expenses caused by tobacco-related cancers and chronic
diseases - some $14 billion in Canada in 2012. It's not primarily the nicotine
that harms smokers; it's the tar and other chemical byproducts from burnt
tobacco.

Another pleasant surprise is that e-cigarettes are actually cheaper than tobacco
for vapers to get the same nicotine dose. This may be because governments impose
heavy taxes on tobacco products (about $7.3 billion per year in Canada), but
haven't yet geared up to extract similar amounts from the nicotine addicts who
have migrated to vaporizers. But for the addicts themselves, it is great news. A
disproportionate number of smokers are concentrated in the poorer segments of
society. If they can save money by substituting vaping for smoking, then they'll
have more money for other things. And if vaping helps them kick the habit
entirely, their finances will improve significantly.

But despite all these clear advantages of the vaping revolution, governments
have dug in their heels, seemingly determined to bring it to a screeching halt.
Major cities including Vancouver and Calgary have adopted bylaws discouraging
vaping. New Brunswick has had legislation hindering vaping since July 2015. And
Ontario has enacted discouraging legislation which was originally supposed to be
implemented on Jan. 1 but has been temporarily deferred.

Federally, the Standing Committee on Health issued a report in March 2015
recommending stringent regulation of vaping.

Since 2009, Health Canada has taken the position that e-cigarettes containing
nicotine are illegal. But out on the streets, Health Canada is simply being
ignored. There's a brisk trade in vaping supplies including nicotine.

Much of the new legislation might be found unconstitutional if challenged in the
courts. Nicotine addicts who still use tobacco as a delivery method are
suffering harm to their health that now appears to be quite unnecessary. Any
government that prevents them from accessing a cost-effective, harm-reduction
product is probably infringing upon their Charter right to security of the
person. That was, after all, the heart of the argument in the Insite safe drug
injection case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2011: individuals have
a right to harm-reduction.

Unlike Insite, where the government had to provide highly-regulated personnel to
supervise addicts, smokers have been switching to vaping of their own
initiative. Frequently, the entrepreneurs who guide them are empathetic
fellow-travellers, despite being profit-seeking businesses. Vapers are looking
after their own well-being and promoting the well-being of others into the
bargain.

And the free market - much reviled among nanny state politicos - is making it
all possible. Troy Media columnist Karen Selick is a lawyer and commentator.

Vaping at work? There should be a policy, experts say

BYLINE: Jim Dino, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 469 words","


Oct. 25--As the vaping community grows, businesses should have a policy for
e-cigarette use in the workplace, experts say.

E-cigarettes have become popular as a way to quit smoking. But there is now a
question whether people who vape in the workplace should get a designated area
like smokers or whether vaping should be allowed at all, said attorney Holly
Cline, a partner in the Buchanan, Ingersoll and Rooney firm in Harrisburg,
during a recent seminar held by the Northeast Pennsylvania Manufacturers and
Employers Association.

Of particular concern is that a person vaping could be using marijuana and
getting high on the job.

Ms. Cline said every company should develop a policy in order to avoid problems
that may develop down the road.

""You have to be as clear and specific as possible, and let the employees know so
there is no potential down the road for argument,"" she said. ""When you put your
policy in place, make it as comprehensive as possible. A safer approach is to
take them into the same consideration as cigarettes. You can simply amend your
policy to make cigarettes extend to e-cigarettes.""

The devices come in a variety of different shapes and sizes and have only been
on the American market for less than a decade. The product remains unregulated
at the federal level, though there are some state and local laws. Some cities
have banned their use in public places. There is an age restriction -- you have
to be 18 to purchase one.

The vapor can worsen indoor air quality and potentially cause eye irritation,
respiratory problems, nausea and headaches.

Ms. Cline said the other dangers they pose are much worse than smoking. You can
put cannabis oil and other things in them and it's possible an employer might
not know what their employees are vaping.

""It makes monitoring drug abuse in the workplace difficult,"" she said. ""More
often than not, you are seeing big employers banning it. The list includes CVS,
Wal-Mart, UPS, Target, Home Depot and Starbucks.""

While the hashish oil is not available in a store that sells e-cigarettes, it
can be obtained on the open market by anyone, said Shohn Montano, a volunteer
firefighter employed by Berwick Offray who became familiar with vaping in a
previous employment situation. Hashish oil can also be manufactured with
household chemicals.

Because the liquid is burned at such a high temperature to create the vapor, he
said it has the potential to be dangerous in any workplace where hazardous or
flammable materials are present.

""I actually saw a person who was doing it who had second- and third-degree burns
because they were doing it inside a car,"" he said.

Is vaping worse than smoking?

ABSTRACT

Maybe the next study won't serve mainly as a scare tactic to keep smokers away
from e-cigarettes.

FULL TEXT

So I suppose you heard about the latest e-cigarette study, the one that said
that the vapors e-cigarette users inhale contain multiple forms of formaldehyde.
It was much in the news last week, after its authors, five scientists from
Portland State University, published a peer-reviewed letter outlining their
findings in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.

''Before You Vape: High Levels of Formaldehyde Hidden in E-Cigs,'' said the
headline at NBC.com. ''Can You Guess What Cancer-Causing Agent Researchers Just
Found in Electronic Cigarettes?'' asked The Motley Fool. ''E-Cigarettes Not
Safer Than Ordinary Cigarettes,'' claimed the online publication Tech Times. The
New England Journal of Medicine chimed in with a tweet of its own: ''Chemical
analysis of e-cigs' vapor show high levels of formaldehyde,'' it read. ''Authors
project higher cancer risk than smoking.''

The study focused on a device known as a premium vaporizer that heats a flavored
liquid containing nicotine. The heat causes the liquid to turn into vapor, which
the user inhales. Most of these devices also allow the user to control the
voltage. These devices have become increasingly popular as a way to ingest
nicotine without smoking.

In the study, the Portland State scientists ran the device at both a low voltage
and a high voltage. At the low voltage, they did not detect formaldehyde. But at
the high voltage, they found some. Formaldehyde is, indeed, a known carcinogen,
which also exists, among hundreds of other toxic chemicals and dozens of
cancer-causing agents, in combustible cigarettes. The authors concluded that
someone who was a heavy user of a vaporizer at the high voltage was five to 15
times more likely to get cancer than a longtime smoker. Or so they seemed to
say.

There is not much doubt that studies like this have an impact on the public
perception of e-cigarettes. Even though cigarettes result in 480,000 American
deaths each year - and even though it is the tobacco, not the nicotine, that
kills them - many in the public health community treat e-cigarettes as every bit
as evil. Every dollop of news suggesting that vaping is bad for your health,
much of which has been overblown, is irrationally embraced by anti-tobacco
activists. One result is that, whereas 84 percent of current smokers thought
e-cigarettes were safer than ordinary cigarettes in 2010, that number had
dropped to 65 percent by 2013.

Worse, close to a third of the people who had abandoned e-cigarettes and
returned to smoking did so because they were worried about the health effects of
vaping, according to a study published last year in the journal Nicotine &
Tobacco Research.

The Portland State study fits right into this dynamic. It is, on the one hand,
factually true that vaping at an extremely high voltage will cause
formaldehyde-releasing agents to develop.

But this conclusion is highly misleading. People don't vape at a high voltage
because it causes a horrible taste -   ''a burning taste that occurs from
overheating the liquid,'' wrote Konstantinos Farsalinos, a Greek scientist and
vaping expert, in an email to me. Farsalinos has done human studies of vaping
and discovered that above a certain voltage - lower than the high voltage test
on the Portland State study - people simply couldn't inhale; the   taste was
unbearable.

Indeed, the study actually conveys good news. When used at normal voltage,
vaping does not produce formaldehyde! ''Rather than scaring people about the
dangers of vaping and alarming them to the 'fact' that vaping raises their
cancer risk above that of smoking, we should instead be regulating the voltage
and temperature conditions of electronic cigarettes so that the problem of
formaldehyde contamination is completely avoided,'' wrote Michael Siegel, a
professor of public health at Boston University, on his blog. But given the way
the Portland State authors characterized their research, it's no surprise that
headline writers took away a different message.

When I spoke to David Peyton, one of the study's authors, he insisted that the
study had been mischaracterized. All it was meant to do, he said, was compare
the levels of formaldehyde in e-cigarettes versus cigarettes. ''It is
exceedingly frustrating to me that we are being associated with saying that
e-cigarettes are more dangerous than cigarettes,'' he added. ''That is a fact
not in evidence.'' Well, maybe.

When I read him the tweet from the New England Journal of Medicine - ''Authors
project higher cancer risk than smoking'' - he sounded horrified. ''I didn't see
the tweet,'' he said. ''I regret that. That is not my opinion.''

''There is a lot we don't yet know about e-cigarettes,'' said Peyton toward the
end of our conversation. He is right about that; e-cigarettes are still so new
that they need to be studied carefully. And he and his co-authors are planning
further studies. Perhaps the next time, they will produce something that doesn't
serve mainly as a scare tactic to keep smokers away from e-cigarettes.

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY


Like many a hard-core smoker, Candi McCann found it a bear to quit. Nothing
worked. Not the patch. Not those blue smoking cessation pills her doctor
prescribed.

Then she tried those electronic cigarettes that produce a steamy vapor instead
of smoke. Click, just like that, she went from more than a pack of smokes a day
to becoming the Kansas City area's leading vaping evangelist.

Finally shed of her 21-year smoking habit, the 42-year-old McCann now preaches
about the latest vaping gear on her YouTube channel. She helps organize ""vape
meets"" of fellow enthusiasts through the Fountain City Vapor Club. And more
recently she has turned her passion into a full-time job, hiring on as manager
at the Vapor World store near her home in Lenexa, Kan.

""April 9, 2012, that's my vape-versery,"" she said, taking a drag from a
mouthpiece sticking out of a boxy contraption in her palm that was about the
size of an eyeglass case.

""I'm not going to tell you this is healthy,"" said McCann. ""But I can tell you
that it is 99 percent better for you than smoking.""

Whether that stat is true or not, that's one selling point that keeps customers
coming back to the more than three dozen vape shops that have set up in the
metro area since 2013. Before, there were few or none.

Then there's the social aspect that has seen some vaping stores, like Waldo
Vapes, becoming something akin to java-free coffee shops, where people gather to
shoot the breeze, play games and challenge each other to see who can blow out
the biggest cloud of scented vapor.

""It's becoming a community,"" Levi Fields, a 20-year-old student at the culinary
school at Johnson County Community College, said as he took a toke in Waldo
Vapes' living-room-like setting. ""It's getting really, really big.""

Supporters see e-cigarettes as a godsend for people trying to reduce or quit
smoking, which kills 480,000 Americans a year, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

But the trend concerns some health advocates. Scientists don't yet know much
about the health effects of electronic cigarettes, which are largely unregulated
and the subject of competing claims.

Critics also contend vaping is trading one form of addiction for another and
that the safer-than-cigarettes claims are convincing teens to adopt a nicotine
habit they might not have otherwise.

""It is a way to get kids addicted to nicotine,"" said Sue Matson, substance abuse
prevention coordinator at the Johnson County Mental Health Department. ""I'm
concerned about the possibility of renormalizing behavior that we have spent a
long time getting away from.""

As the federal Food and Drug Administration weighs those arguments in advance of
imposing greater regulatory control, there is no debating this: Vaping has gone
mainstream in the past couple of years, spawning a more than $3 billion-a-year
industry in the United States. Two-thirds of sales are online, but increasingly
there are brick-and-mortar stores like the dozens of outlets that have been
cropping up across the nation.

You've seen them on street corners and in strip centers with names like Vape Up,
Vape Room and CigaWatt.

Until recently, e-cigarettes were synonymous with the cigarette look-a-likes
sold alongside regular smokes in gas station convenience stores - ""cig-a-likes,""
they're called. Marketed by Big Tobacco, they are an acceptable alternative to
smoking for many smokers, while others dismiss brands like Blu, Vuze and Njoy as
unsatisfying substitutes for the real thing.

But that is not the segment seeing the biggest growth and getting the most buzz.
Instead, it's the refillable ""open system"" vaping product category that is
driving an industry that within a decade, one prominent Wall Street analyst
predicts, will see more Americans vaping than smoking tobacco.

Open systems allow users to customize their vaping experience.

They can choose among a wide array of flavored liquids - from
bubble-gum-flavored to hazelnut butter cream - each of which has various levels
of nicotine to none at all. Drops of that ""e-juice"" are dripped into
battery-powered gadgets that look nothing like cigarettes.

They range from rechargeable vaping pens, called that because they look like
writing instruments and cost about $25 for a starter kit, to so-called modified
systems. Mods, for short, are built from mix-and-match components that can cost
as little as $40 to as much as a few hundred dollars. The price goes up along
with the wattage options. The more power, the more vapor.

Customers range in motivation, too. Some stop in only when they need to feed
their nicotine habit.

""They buy their juice coils once a week and go about their day,"" McCann said.

But there is also a dedicated bunch who consider themselves hobbyists. They
enjoy sampling different flavors and buying better and more expensive vaping
equipment.

And yet as big as vaping has become in a short amount of time, it's far from
being widely accepted outside the subculture that has grown up around it.

Which is why shop owners like Jonathan Brower, owner of Waldo Vapes, are wary of
and bracing for new rules that are sure to come down the pike eventually.

""People have a hard time wrapping their head around the fact that we're not
smoking anything,"" he said.

There may not be smoke, but local, state and federal officials are fired up
about the need to regulate e-cigarettes.

Overland Park and Columbia, for example, are among a number of Kansas and
Missouri communities that have extended prohibitions already imposed on smoking
to vaping. It's not allowed in indoor public spaces, confounding smokers who had
been vaping in bars rather than stepping outside to light up.

That makes it hard sometimes for the 800-member Fountain City Vapor Club to rent
space for its occasional meets, McCann said.

""The meets we hold every few months are free to attend,"" she said. ""We invite
local shops to set up tables. There are usually raffle and door prizes.""

Also, both Missouri and Kansas are among the states that forbid the sale of
e-cigarettes and vaping gear to minors, a restriction that local vaping store
operators welcome.

""The main thing we're fighting now is we're getting a lot of minors trying to
buy,"" said Aaron Todd, who owns the Vapur of KC store and is part owner of two
other Vapur stores in the area. ""I even had one kid come in with his dad, point
out what he wanted and slide his dad a $20 bill, and I wouldn't sell it to him.""

More than anything, it's that concern for minors that is driving opposition
locally and nationally.

A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the
use of e-cigarettes by teenagers had risen sharply, with 13 percent of high
schoolers reportedly using them in 2014.

At the same time, though, the number of high school smokers had dropped from 16
percent in 2011 to 9 percent in 2014.

""They (teenagers) believe it's a safe alternative because that's what they are
being told,"" said Kevin Kufeldt, who runs a regional drug treatment center that
serves adolescents from across Kansas.

To dissuade teens and their parents from vaping, Tri-County Mental Health
Services in the Northland plans to begin sending out public service
announcements through social media this summer.

The theme, said Tri-County's Reshana Peterson, is ""about the fact that nicotine
is nicotine.""

Many adults, she said, believe they are doing their teens a favor by allowing
them to vape, rather than smoke, when the better alternative is to do neither.

The campaign, paid for by a grant from the Health Care Foundation of Greater
Kansas City, also includes an educational component for teachers so they can
recognize signs that kids are vaping in class.

Johnson County has the same challenge, Matson said.

""Kids are doing it in their cars,"" she said. ""Kids are doing it in the hallways
and the classroom if they think they can get away with it.""

Some school districts have changed their regulations recently to prohibit all
nicotine products, rather than just tobacco, because of the trend, Peterson
said.

Another area where regulation is coming involves the products themselves. No
quality control standards apply. While manufacturers and shop owners say the
industry's products are safe, vaping juices are not tested or regulated. At
least one study found that some liquids said to contain no nicotine did, in
fact, have nicotine in them.

""You can put whatever you want on a label,"" Kufeldt said. ""It doesn't mean it's
true.""

Many in the industry wouldn't mind the FDA getting involved for that very
reason. One of the biggest impediments to further growth in the category is the
loss of consumer confidence in the vapor people are breathing in place of
tobacco smoke.

""We believe it's imperative these factors are addressed promptly,"" three
analysts who follow the industry at Wells Fargo Securities said in a January
report. ""If not, we're concerned that vapor category growth could continue to
moderate.""

McCann would be sad if regulation damaged what she considers to be an industry
that has helped a lot of people like her cut back on or quit cigarettes
entirely.

""It meets my need,"" she said. ""I don't smell like smoke anymore. I don't get
bronchitis anymore.""

And she'd miss the folks she's met at vape meets, where there's always a bit of
horse trading amid the vapor rings and billowing clouds of mist.

""We swap juices and show off our mods,"" she said.

And surely, she said, there's no harm in that.

Each year, smoking kills nearly half a million Americans, according to the
Center for Disease Control

FLAMES OF CONTROVERSY

Scientists don't yet know the long-term effects of vaping, so there are few
regulations. As the $3 billion industry grows, some shop owners are nervous
about what regulations they may face in the future.

TEEN SMOKING DOWN,TEEN VAPING UP

Since 2011, teen smoking has dropped from 16 percent in 2011 to 9 percent in
2014. However, vaping among teens has increased sharply to 13 percent in 2014.
Most in the industry agree there should be age-related regulations introduced by
the FDA as the vaping industry gains popularity.

Sask. towns have plenty of issues to discuss; The Saskatchewan Urban
Municipalities Association (SUMA) convention, on this week in Regina, gives
communities the opportunity to put forth resolutions on issues of local and
provincial importance. Natascia Lypny shares a taste of the resolutions that
delegates will discuss Tuesday

SMOKING AND VAPING

The Saskatchewan City Mayors Caucus wants SUMA to advocate the Ministry of
Health to ban smoking and vaping in public places provincewide.

The resolution states the ""negative effects of smoking both for smokers and
those exposed to second-hand smoke"" and the ""undetermined"" health effects of
vaping.

A handful of municipalities have implemented their own anti-smoking-and-vaping
bylaws. SUMA president Debra Button said having such legislation at the
provincial level will provide consistency and reduce confusion for the public.

FIRE PROTECTION

The northern village of Air Ronge is looking to the province for two fire
protection improvements stemming from last year's wildfires.

The village wants fire guards developed and maintained around all northern
communities. The resolution cites communities' single access routes, a desire to
avoid the need for evacuations and the protection of property and
infrastructure.

A second resolution highlights the community's concern over the north's limited
power grid and wooden poles at risk of burning down. It asks that SaskPower
replace the poles with steel versions for Air Ronge, La Ronge and Lac La Ronge
Indian Band.

An education session on lessons learned from last year's wildfires took place on
Monday at the convention.

TRANSIT

The village of Invermay wants the province to more equitably fund municipal
transit services for people with disabilities.

The provincial Transit Assistance for People with Disabilities Program provides
money to communities for services like Regina's Paratransit. But the resolution
says some villages and rural municipalities that offer similar services are not
being captured under this program.

The resolution calls for the province to increase funding to cover all
communities that offer such a service and to dole out more funds to help renew
existing fleets.

BURIALS

The cost of burying people who die without money to their name is proving
expensive for some communities, so the town of Shellbrook would like the
province to help out.

The Cemeteries Act requires that municipalities or the owners of commercial
cemeteries provide interment free of charge for unclaimed bodies or the deceased
without any financial assets.

In its resolution, Shellbrook said this is putting financial pressure on
municipalities, as cemeteries generate little revenue and costs continue to
grow.

It recommends that these costs instead be funded by the Saskatchewan Assistance
Program.

LANDFILLS

The village of Neville is pushing for some leniency from the provincial
government when it comes to requirements for decommissioning landfills.

The resolution says the government is trying to reduce the number of waste sites
across the province.

But smaller communities could be ""bankrupt"" by the $300,000 to $500,000 cost to
close a landfill, it says.

Neville is advocating the Ministry of Environment use a ""sliding scale"" based on
population to enforce the environmental guidelines for decommissioning or
provide assistance to meet them. nlypny@postmedia.com twitter.com/worpuddle

City council to vote on future of vaping; Change proposes adding e-cigarettes to
smoking restriction bylaw

BYLINE: Sean Trembath, The Starphoenix

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 511 words","


Jim Wollf has heard the same story time and time again from customers at his
vape shop.

""They came in, they weren't sure, they bought a kit from us, then you see them a
week later and they say they haven't had one cigarette since the day they bought
it. It's a very positive thing,"" Wollf, one of the owners of Heavy Jam Vapour
Supply in Saskatoon, said.

The use of electronic cigarettes, or vaping, could become much more restricted
in the city if a proposed change to the local smoking bylaw is approved by city
council Monday. The change would make vaping identical to smoking in the eyes of
the law as of Jan. 1, meaning it would be prohibited in public buildings, bus
shelters, schools, businesses and other places cigarettes are currently not
allowed. Wollf said he understands the argument that vaping puts unnatural
chemicals into a person's body, but argued it should be looked at as a
harm-reduction strategy.

""Almost anybody you talk to, they'll say, 'I know this isn't a great thing to be
doing to myself, but if I wasn't doing this, I'd be out smoking a pack and a
half of cigarettes a day.' "" he said.

City councillor Pat Lorje brought forth the proposed bylaw change. When asked
why she thinks vaping should be equated with regular cigarettes, her answer was
to the point.

""Why shouldn't it be?"" Lorje said. Council recently approved another change to
the bylaw banning smoking from any public area other than streets and sidewalks.
That change is also set to take effect Jan. 1, and vaping would be prohibited in
those areas as a result if council approves the new change Monday.

Lorje said she sees nothing wrong with general disincentives toward tobacco use.

""We've seen smoking rates drop dramatically, and I think that's a good thing,""
she said.

The report in Monday's council agenda asks for clarification on two points.
First, it points out there is no allowance made for specialty shops and says
such an article could be added. Lorje said she is still considering this
question.

""I don't use the product, so I don't have any personal knowledge of whether it
is essential to try it out before you buy it,"" she said.

Wollf said not being allowed to demo products would be a significant hit to his
business. Some of the vaping liquid is fairly expensive, he said, and it is also
important to demonstrate how to use one of the electronic cigarettes for a first
timer.

""It's not an overly complicated thing, but when it's something new, it can be a
lot of information to take in,"" he said.

The second point of clarification sought in the report for council concerns
traditional aboriginal ceremonies. There is already a carveout in the provincial
smoking law allowing for tobacco use indoors in cultural and spiritual events.
The report says a similar article could be added to the city bylaw.

Lorje said she fully supports such an amendment.

""Absolutely. I think it's important as one order of government to another that
we show respect,"" she said.

Thumbs up for school vape ban

SECTION: Pg. 2

LENGTH: 457 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: Parents, students and educationists have given the thumbs up to
the proposed ban on electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and vaping in schools
and institutes of higher learning.

Mother of two, Ratnawati Wasli, said she welcomed the proposal as it would stop
students and adults with a devil-may-care attitude from vaping in school
compounds.

""Not only are they (vapers) setting a bad example for youngsters, but many times
during traffic jams, I have seen adults vaping inside cars full of children. I
find most vapers feel they can smoke e-cigs anywhere and at any time.""

Selangor Parent-Teacher Association deputy president Mohamed Saufi Shafie lauded
the move.

He said it was time to tackle the problem as it was spreading like wildfire,
adding that even children had been seen vaping.

""Many parents and educators are concerned about the possibility that vaping
could be a gateway to developing a smoking habit and the consumption of illegal
drugs.

""It is an alarming trend, and there have already been cases where these devices
were found in students' bags.

""What is more shocking is that e-cigarettes have also been found in the bags of
primary schoolgirls.""

Saufi,  who is also SMK Rawang PTA president, urged the authorities to look into
the sale of e-cigarettes and vaping devices to children.

""He also urged parents to ensure that their kids did not get involved in vaping.

Ismail Salkilan, who has four children, said e-cigarette usage should be
restricted to designated areas.

""The sweet and fruity scents emitted by e-cigarettes could attract teenagers and
it would be difficult for parents to detect anything because, unlike tobacco
smoke, there won't be any residual smell.

""Even though they could be less harmful to health compared with cigarettes
because there is no burning of tobacco, there will be long-term social effects
and health issues, just like tobacco use.""

Muhd Nadzmi Nasir, 21, said the ban was timely as many states had banned it or
declared it haram.

The Raffles University Iskandar, Johor, student said it was a wasteful habit.

""Vape devices and flavoured liquids are not cheap. The money can be channelled
to more beneficial activities, instead.""

Ali Imran Mansor Adabi, 20, agreed with the ban.

""There is a certain amount of nicotine when vaping, but because it is not as
high as in cigarettes, they think it is harmless and does not bother people
around them.""

On Dec 24, the Education Ministry announced that it would issue a directive to
ban e-cigarettes and their use in the compounds of schools and educational
institutes under its purview.

Education Minister Datuk Seri Mahdzir Khalid said the ministry was in the final
stages of preparing the directive, which is expected to be issued early next
year.

Just mention the phrase ""electronic ciga -rettes"" and politicians at every level
seem to go berserk. ""Holy nonsmokes!"", they cry. ""We can't allow something new
and unregulated to exist in the marketplace! People might just solve their own
problems without us!"" From its infancy in 2003, the market for e-cigarettes has
skyrocketed. It is now estimated to be a $3.5 billion business worldwide. As
someone who hates being accosted by sidestream smoke from burning tobacco
sticks, I welcome this development. In fact, I recently spent about 90 minutes
in a ""vape shop,"" meeting with several vaping entrepreneurs. Even though two or
three people were vaping nearby throughout the meeting, I experienced no
discomfort. All I noticed was a slight, pleasant, fruity aroma in the air when I
walked into the shop. Had people been consuming equivalent amounts of tobacco
sticks in that space, I wouldn't have been able to spend two minutes there
without starting to cough and gasp for air.

Indeed, scientific studies confirm that there is virtually no risk to bystanders
from secondhand vapour, unlike secondhand tobacco smoke.

The vapers I met were former tobacco smokers themselves. E-cigarettes had let
them wean themselves off tobacco. Thousands (perhaps millions) of people are
doing the same. This was more news to gladden my heart. I hate paying taxes to
support the huge medical expenses caused by tobacco-related cancers and chronic
diseases - some $14 billion in Canada in 2012. It's not primarily the nicotine
that harms smokers; it's the tar and other chemical byproducts from burnt
tobacco.

Another pleasant surprise is that e-cigarettes are actually cheaper than tobacco

for vapers to get the same nicotine dose. This may be because governments impose
heavy taxes on tobacco products (about $7.3 billion per year in Canada), but
haven't yet geared up to extract similar amounts from the nicotine addicts who
have migrated

to vaporizers. But for the addicts themselves, it is great news. A
disproportionate number of smokers are concentrated in the poorer segments of
society. If they can save money by substituting vaping for smoking, then they'll
have more money for other things. And if vaping helps them kick the habit
entirely, their finances will improve significantly. But despite all these clear
advantages of the vaping revolution, governments have dug in their heels,
seemingly determined to bring it to a screeching halt. Major cities including
Vancouver and Calgary have adopted bylaws discouraging vaping; New Brunswick has
had legislation hindering vaping since July, 2015, and Ontario's discouraging
legislation will be implemented on Jan. 1, 2016.

Federally, the Standing Committee on Health issued a report in March, 2015
recommending stringent regulation of vaping. Since 2009, Health Canada has taken
the position that e-cigarettes containing nicotine are illegal. But out on the
streets, Health Canada is simply being ignored. There's a brisk trade in vaping
supplies including nicotine.

Much of the new legislation might be found unconstitutional if challenged in the
courts. Nicotine addicts who still use tobacco as a delivery method are
suffering harm to their health that now appears to be quite unnecessary. Any
government that prevents them from accessing a costeffective harm-reduction
product is probably infringing upon their Charter right to security of the
person. That was, after all, the heart of the argument in the Insite safe drug
injection case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2011: individuals have
a right to harm-reduction.

Unlike Insite, where the government had to provide highly regulated personnel to
supervise addicts, smokers have been switching to vaping of their own
initiative. Frequently, the entrepreneurs who guide them are empathetic
fellow-travellers, despite being profit-seeking businesses. Vapers are looking
after their own well-being and promoting the well-being of others into the
bargain. And the free market - much reviled among nanny state politicos - is
making it all possible.

Who will be the first Ontarian to be charged after Jan. 1? Will it be a hapless
nicotine addict who emits some steam in a forbidden location? Or a rebellious
shop refusing to comply with signage and advertising regulations? It may well be
that the law's strict restrictions on what vendors can say about vaping products
is another Charter violation, of the right to freedom of expression.

We'll be watching.

Sir, Further to Matt Ridley's article (Sept 28), although I support the view
that EU regulations should not place more onerous regulation on vaping than on
smoking, we need clear UK legislation on where vaping is permitted. The ban on
smoking in many public places has benefited the non-smoking population, who have
been able to enjoy public transport, restaurants and bars without the smell and
health risks associated with tobacco smoke.

The same ban should be applied to vaping; at present it does not appear to be
covered because it produces vapour rather than smoke. This vapour contains a
smell and other byproducts, however, the effects of which are not fully
understood.

Although smokers may choose to take the view that vaping is less harmful than
smoking and may consider that their chosen ""flavour"" is less offensive than
tobacco smoke, the wider and non-smoking population should not be subjected to
vapour any more than it is to smoke.

G2: Health: Dr Dillner's dilemma Should I take up vaping in order to stop
smoking?

Cheryl Cole, Robert Pattinson and Kate Moss have all been seen ""vaping"". Puffing
on e-cigarettes, which produce vapour instead of smoke has been tried by up to
35% of smokers, according to the public health charity Ash (Action on Smoking
and Health). The number of UK users rose from 700,000 last year to 1.3 million
this year. Smokers seem to use them on top off their normal cigarette intake, or
to help them quit.

But are e-cigarettes much less damaging than the real thing? These
battery-operated devices contain a cartridge filled with a liquid solution of
nicotine, propylene glycol (used in special effects to create fog) and
flavourings that range from traditional tobacco to candy floss. Puffing
activates a heating element that vapourises the liquid in the cartridge,
producing a mist that is inhaled.

Vaping has divided the medical community. Some doctors sensibly say that it is
best to avoid inhaling chemicals altogether, that no long term research exists
on the safety of e-cigarettes and that there is no evidence that they help
people stop smoking.

Others argue that they are much safer than cigarettes, therefore it is a
no-brainer to encourage smokers to switch to vaping. This summer, the Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it would regulate
e-cigarettes from 2016. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has offered
guidance suggesting they are best avoided. So, should you make the switch?

The solution

The amount of nicotine contained in e-cigarettes varies. (Smoking can make blood
nicotine levels reach 15 to 20 nanograms per millilitre compared with between 3
and 5 ng/ml for vaping.) Nicotine causes a rise in blood pressure and heart rate
and is highly addictive. Propylene glycol irritates the lungs when inhaled. A
small study from Greece suggested that vaping made it harder to move air through
the airways in the lungs. But Ash argues that what evidence there is suggests
only mild side-effects and low toxicity for vaping.

A recent 12-month study took 300 Italian smokers who were not intending to quit
and randomised them into three groups. They were given e-cigarettes of varying
nicotine concentrations to use. After a year, 11% had given up smoking - a
figure comparable to, but no better than other nicotine-replacement therapies
such as patches. The number of cigarettes smoked by those who didn't give up
fell by half across all groups. Smoking is so bad that it is hard to see how
vaping can't be better. But it is still best to not inhale chemicals at all.

EU ruling on vaping and addiction to tobacco;
Letters to the Editor

SECTION: LETTERS; Pg. 30

LENGTH: 641 words","


Sir, Matt Ridley's analysis and conclusion concerning e-cigarettes must not be
allowed to go unchallenged (""Threat to vaping is a backward step for UK"", Feb
15).

Although we share the hope that vaping might provide a safer alternative to
conventional tobacco smoking, the statement by Public Health England (which
Ridley quotes) that vaping is 95 per cent safer than [tobacco] smoking is
groundless. We, and others, have shown that there is insufficient scientific
evidence of an acceptable quality or quantity, or relevance and reliability, to
permit an objective and meaningful risk assessment. Also, it is known that, in
addition to nicotine, e-cigarette vapour contains a number of harmful chemicals
at potentially significant levels.

The human respiratory system is a delicate vehicle, on which the length and
quality of our lives depend. For governments and companies to condone, or even
suggest, the regular and repeated inhaling of a complex mixture of chemicals
with addictive and toxic properties, but without comprehensive data, is
irresponsible and could have serious consequences.

Far from ""leading the way, with more people having quit smoking by taking up
vaping than in other countries"", there is a danger that Britain may be laying
the foundations for a public health disaster, albeit one that may not become
apparent for decades. Only one piece of advice is worth giving: quit smoking
anything. michael balls Emeritus professor of medical cell biology, University
of Nottingham dr robert combes Independent consultant in toxicology Sir, Matt
Ridley cites the example of the use of methadone and buprenorphine in the
treatment of heroin addiction; the reason this works is because precise and
reducing doses can be given to wean the addict off heroin. The tobacco industry
has branched out into the supply of e-cigarettes because it realises that this
feeds the addiction, and users are likely at some point to revert to cigarette
smoking when, for example, they find themselves out with friends and they have
run out of their supply.

The most success in smoking cessation has been through the use of nicotine
patches, which enable the user to precisely satisfy their cravings, and by the
stepping down of the nicotine dose to ultimately remove the addiction
completely. There is no reason why e-cigarettes could not be used in the same
way, but to do this they must be regulated and supplied like any other medicinal
substance. John lauder North Bradley, Wilts Sir, Matt Ridley uses strong
language when appraising the European ruling on e-cigarettes in the tobacco
product directive, but this is fully justified. The ruling is based on poor
understanding of nicotine toxicity and effects and seems driven by moralistic
zeal with no consideration for the consequences of protecting cigarettes from
their much safer competitor.

In the UK, a pragmatic approach to tobacco control has started to prevail that
focuses on reducing smokingrelated morbidity, rather than eradication of
nicotine use. The EU ruling, however, will trump all that. Future textbooks will
have fun with this particular piece of spectacularly misguided regulation. In
the meantime, smokers - who could avoid premature death if e-cigarettes were not
subjected to hostile overregulation - will continue to smoke. professor peter
HAJEK Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine Sir, Matt Ridley's argument looks
strong but the situation in the case of tobacco is complicated by the
involvement of the tobacco industry in the e-cigarette business. There is
legitimate concern that it might subvert this technology to keep people smoking
- for example, by promoting products that are not very effective in aiding
cessation.

Unfortunately the EU directive may strengthen the tobacco industry's grip on
this market. We shall see.

Why do e-cigarettes spark political confusion?

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 726 words","


BELLEVILLE, Ont. * Just mention the phrase ""electronic cigarettes"" and
politicians at every level seem to go berserk. ""Holy non-smokes!"", they cry. ""We
can't allow something new and unregulated to exist in the marketplace! People
might just solve their own problems without us!""

From its infancy in 2003, the market for e-cigarettes has skyrocketed. It is now
estimated to be a $3.5 billion dollar business worldwide.

As someone who hates being accosted by sidestream smoke from burning tobacco
sticks, I welcome this development.

In fact, I recently spent about 90 minutes in a ""vape shop"", meeting with
several vaping entrepreneurs. Even though two or three people were vaping nearby
throughout the meeting, I experienced no discomfort. All I noticed was a slight,
pleasant, fruity aroma in the air when I walked into the shop. Had people been
consuming equivalent amounts of tobacco sticks in that space, I wouldn't have
been able to spend two minutes there without starting to cough and gasp for air.

Indeed, scientific studies confirm that there is virtually no risk to bystanders
from second-hand vapour, unlike second-hand tobacco smoke.

The vapers I met were former tobacco smokers themselves. E-cigarettes had let
them wean themselves off tobacco. Thousands (perhaps millions) of people are
doing the same. This was more news to gladden my heart. I hate paying taxes to
support the huge medical expenses caused by tobacco-related cancers and chronic
diseases - some $14 billion in Canada in 2012. It's not primarily the nicotine
that harms smokers; it's the tar and other chemical by-products from burnt
tobacco.

Another pleasant surprise is that e-cigarettes are actually cheaper than tobacco
for vapers to get the same nicotine dose. This may be because governments impose
heavy taxes on tobacco products (about $7.3 billion per year in Canada), but
haven't yet geared up to extract similar amounts from the nicotine addicts who
have migrated to vaporizers. But for the addicts themselves, it is great news. A
disproportionate number of smokers are concentrated in the poorer segments of
society. If they can save money by substituting vaping for smoking, then they'll
have more money for other things. And if vaping helps them kick the habit
entirely, their finances will improve significantly.

But despite all these clear advantages of the vaping revolution, governments
have dug in their heels, seemingly determined to bring it to a screeching halt.
Major cities including Vancouver and Calgary have adopted bylaws discouraging
vaping. New Brunswick has had legislation hindering vaping since July, 2015. And
Ontario has enacted discouraging legislation which was originally supposed to be
implemented on January 1, 2016 but has been temporarily deferred.

Federally, the Standing Committee on Health issued a report in March, 2015
recommending stringent regulation of vaping.

Since 2009, Health Canada has taken the position that e-cigarettes containing
nicotine are illegal. But out on the streets, Health Canada is simply being
ignored. There's a brisk trade in vaping supplies including nicotine.

Much of the new legislation might be found unconstitutional if challenged in the
courts. Nicotine addicts who still use tobacco as a delivery method are
suffering harm to their health that now appears to be quite unnecessary. Any
government that prevents them from accessing a cost-effective harm-reduction
product is probably infringing upon their Charter right to security of the
person. That was, after all, the heart of the argument in the Insite safe drug
injection case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2011: individuals have
a right to harm-reduction.

Unlike Insite, where the government had to provide highly-regulated personnel to
supervise addicts, smokers have been switching to vaping of their own
initiative. Frequently, the entrepreneurs who guide them are empathetic
fellow-travellers, despite being profit-seeking businesses. Vapers are looking
after their own well-being and promoting the well-being of others into the
bargain.

And the free market - much reviled among nanny state politicos - is making it
all possible.

Vape shop opens in downtown Niles

LENGTH: 297 words","


Jan. 04--Offering a wide variety of e-liquid and vaping products, Mister-E's
Electronic Cigarettes is now open in Niles.

The store, which opened Dec. 14, is located downtown in the Riverfront Shopping
Center at 30 E. Main St.

Manager Robert Knoblauch, who has worked in the e-cigarette industry for years,
said the vaping industry is growing.

""It has really gained a lot of steam within the last three years,"" he said,
adding that the majority of his customers are former cigarette smokers who have
decided to take up vaping instead.

Knoblauch said while he can't say that vaping is a healthier alternative to
cigarettes, he personally feels better after making the switch to vaping.

Mister-E's offers approximately 65 flavors of e-liquid that is made in house in
what Knoblauch calls a ""clean room"" that resembles a laboratory.

The business also offers everything from e-cig starter kits to variable wattage
devices and various e-cig accessories.

Customers can also try out every flavor at the store's e-bar or vape while
drinking coffee in the small vapor lounge.

Mister E's currently has four employees at its Niles location: Knoblauch, Teresa
Thompson, of Buchanan; Jordan Moore, of Niles; and Danielle Pompey, of Niles.

Knoblauch said he worked at a Mister-E's store in Okemos for two years before
moving to run the Niles store.

There are four Mister-E's locations in Michigan.

The Niles location is open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and from
noon to 5 p.m. Saturday.

People can shop online at mister-e-liquid.com or check out the Niles location on
Facebook.

York County vaping stores welcome stricter FDA regulations

BYLINE: By SARA BLUMBERG 505-5432/@saraeblumberg

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 647 words","


When he helped open the S.S. Vape off Loucks Road, district manager Jason Goins
knew federal regulations wouldn't be far behind.

So he became proactive. He doesn't sell to anyone under 18, doesn't give out
free samples and includes health warnings on the products he sells.

""We run a clean shop and make sure we are ready for any FDA changes,"" he said.
""If you're going to run a business like this, you have to anticipate this.""

Since bursting into the U.S. market in the late 2000s, products like
e-cigarettes and vape accessories have become popular among many York County
residents looking to stop smoking.

The sale of e-cigarettes and vape products remained largely unregulated, but
that could soon change as officials from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
look to tighten control.

It's a change welcomed by many York County vape shops looking to run and expand
legitimate businesses.

""If you're a smart business, you include this in your business model,"" Goins
said.

S.S. Vape, in West Manchester, has nearly a dozen locations between York County
and Maryland and plans to open more shops within the next two years.

What it is: Vaping is the act of inhaling a vapor from a nicotine-infused juice
that is ""smoked"" through an electronic cigarette.

Goins said vaping helped him quit smoking, and the shop is helping many York
County residents do the same.

Some of the regulations, which were introduced last year, include reviewing new
tobacco products for approval by the FDA, stopping the selling of products to
minors and include health warning labels on certain products.

The FDA currently regulates cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own
tobacco, and smokeless tobacco.

The extended provisions are part of the implementation of the Family Smoking
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act signed by the President Barack Obama in 2009.

Members of the American Vaping Association, a national group promoting vape as a
way to quit smoking, have been opposed to the regulations, saying FDA regulators
""jumped the gun"" with the changes, according to a press release.

Local reaction: J.R. Russell, co-owner of One Step Up in West Manchester
Township, said regulations are a good thing for those trying to run legitimate
vaping businesses.

But he hopes the FDA does it the right way, by not harboring too many controls
over vape-business owners.

""When there is too much restriction, it will drive the products underground,
which will hurt legitimate businesses,"" he said.

Russell has converted his shop, which previously operated as a smoke accessory
store, into a full vape store. Since the conversion, he said he's seen about a
half-dozen vape shops open around him.

For the new shops opening up, he says the regulations might make it harder for
those business owners to get started.

""If you don't put the time into your business, it will fail,"" Russell said.

Russell hopes the regulations will help tackle the selling of vape products
online, which he finds are not always regulated.

""That's where you find the dark side of vaping,"" he said. ""That's where the
enforcement needs to be.""

Russell is also planning to expand his enterprise in the next year.

Dr. Karen Rizzo, president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society, said the
organization has long been in favor of federal regulations for vape and
e-cigarette products.

""While e-cigarettes can help someone stop smoking, it can also have the opposite
effect,"" she said.

The medical society has been watching vaping and e-cigarettes grow in popularity
over the last five years. Rizzo said that in that growth, a lot of the marketing
has been shifted to teenagers interested in experimenting .

""From our perspective,the more its regulated, the more information will spread
about potential consequences of tobacco,"" she said.

As of July, the proposed FDA regulations have not gone into effect.

`Ministry should continue raids on vape shops'

SECTION: Pg. 29

LENGTH: 260 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Council for Tobacco Control (MCTC) has urged the
Health Ministry to continue cracking down on e-cigarette or vape sellers.

Its president, Dr Molly Cheah, said the ministry should not be lax just because
certain quarters cried foul when the raids were conducted to seize e-cigarette
liquids from vape shops.

""We see that everyone can buy e-cigarette liquids, including schoolchildren.

""Before this, they (vapers) would say vaping is an alternative to smoking
cigarette, but the culture is expanding, including in shopping malls,"" she said
at the Dang Wangi police station here yesterday.

Cheah said humans needed good air quality and vaping was affecting everyone.

""We are asking the cabinet to review (the decision). It is wrong not to ban
vaping. We want the Health Ministry to do its job. We will push for a total ban
on e-cigarettes and vaping,"" she said.

On Oct 30, Rural and Regional Development Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri
Yaakob said on his Facebook posting that the cabinet had decided not to ban
vaping.

The Health Ministry, however, raided more than 300 vape shops, confiscating vape
liquids containing nicotine.

MCTC member Shaari Ahmad Junid, who represented the Muslim Missionary Society of
Selangor and Wilayah Persekutuan, said the vaping culture was new and could harm
the younger generation's health if it was not curbed.

On Sunday, Pertubuhan Ikatan Usahawan Kecil dan Sederhana Malaysia president
Mohd Ridzuan Abdullah lodged a police report against Health Minister Datuk Seri
Dr S. Subramaniam following the raids.

Fatwa declares e-cig, vaping 'haram' for Muslims

LENGTH: 239 words","

DATELINE: Kuala Lumpur


Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 24 -- Smoking e-cigarettes and vaping has been declared
'haram' for Muslims in Malaysia, the country's national fatwa council has
announced.

The council after a special meeting decided to issue fatwa declaring
e-cigarettes and vaping 'haram' - forbidden for Muslims.

Islamic Sharia Council chairman Abdul Shukor Husin said that based on scientific
studies, they have found that vaping does not benefit users.

""The council finds that the consumption of something that is harmful, whether
direct or indirectly, purposely or not, could lead to harm or death; so this
will not be allowed,"" he told reporters here.

Shukor noted that vaping could be considered as something that was distasteful
in Islam and could be harmful to the users.

""From the Shariah perspective, Muslims cannot consume something that is harmful
to their health or indulge in things that are wasteful,"" he said.

He said authorities had the power to ban the use of vape and electronic
cigarettes if they had an impact on public health.

E-cigarettes, which provide a nicotine hit without the cancer-causing chemicals
found in tobacco, are already banned for Muslims in four Malaysian states, as
well as several other Muslim countries, including Kuwait and the UAE.

Vaping etiquette: the best way to ensure smoke without ire

BYLINE: Chris Smyth

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 652 words","


The surging popularity of electronic cigarettes has prompted calls for
regulation, bans, or prescriptions on the NHS. Now a group of users say that the
controversial devices need something more important: an etiquette guide.

With about two million people using e-cigarettes, confusion over the rules on ""
vaping"" in restaurants, offices and on public transport is rife, with some
prohibiting it and others unclear.

The New Nicotine Alliance, a users' group set up to help fight ""kneejerk"" bans,
aims to develop guidance for users on how to vape considerately. Gerry Stimson,
a board member, wants this to become a ""five-point guide to vaping etiquette"".

Lorien Jollye, a fellow board member, said: ""It's happened so quickly that,
whereas with smoking over a period of time there has become an unspoken
etiquette, vaping hasn't had that opportunity. If you're going to request that
vaping isn't banned in public places, then vapers themselves need to be
considerate. It's only polite.""

What such a code might include, however, is hotly debated among vapers. Many
agree that emitting huge clouds of vapour - known as ""cloudchasing"" - is
impolite in public places. ""Most people accept that isn't something you do in
public or over dinner. We can't expect to sit in a public place and do something
that was very intrusive for other people. But normal use isn't intrusive,"" Ms
Jollye said.

After that the consensus quickly breaks down. ""One [rule] might be, don't use a
highly flavoured mixture in places where people might get upset,"" Professor
Stimson said. ""It's like you don't want people going wearing massive amounts of
aftershave or perfume."" Ms Jollye disagreed, insisting that strong flavours,
which range from banana custard to latte, are an integral part of the
experience. ""I hate the smell of egg sandwiches, but I can't expect people to
emit no smell when they're eating,"" she reasoned.

She also insisted that there was no reason for vapers to hide their devices in
public, arguing that visible vaping could encourage smokers to switch.

Other vapers argue that one should avoid vaping in supermarkets, or find a
dedicated room at the office.

Some experts believe that e-cigarettes could save lives if smokers switch,
because they contain only nicotine, not cancer-causing tobacco. Other public
health experts have called for a crackdown on vaping for fear that it will make
smoking appear normal again.

Professor Stimson argues that this is ""disingenuous"" because new generations of
e-cigarettes look increasingly different from the early ""cig-a-like"" devices
designed to mimic tobacco smoking. ""These products can no longer be confused
with cigarettes,"" he said.

Lookalikes to rocket launchers:how devices have evolved As more smokers kick the
habit with the help of e-cigarettes, the vaping industry has kept up by
producing more devices (Chris Smyth writes).

The ""first generation"" are cigarette lookalikes. Most recent quitters use them,
buying the product for about £10. In 2014, 60 per cent of vapers were still
using this type. However, they are mostly disposable, prompting frequent users
to move on to ""second generation"" e-cigarettes.

These are often longer, shaped like a pen, and have cartridges of e-liquid that
can be replaced. Flavours come in all varieties, from mango to smoked salmon,
although most can only be bought online. Cartridge refills cost £1 to £2,
e-liquid refills are £4 per 10ml.

The ""third generation"" of e-cigarettes, or ""mods"" as they are known because
different parts are sold separately, are new and are more like rocket launchers
than anything found in a packet of Marlboro. These are for the real enthusiasts
who will invest up to £160 for some devices.

About 40 per cent of vapers used second and third generation e-cigarettes last
year, but it is predicted by ECIGINTELLIGENCE,a consulting firm, that this year
at least 60 per cent of users will opt for the more hi-tech versions.

e-cigarettes in both the city's no-smoking policy - which prohibits smoking in
city-owned buildings and public outdoor spaces - and the smoking control bylaw,
which bans smoking in restaurants, cafes and other licensed premises.

""It would seem odd to me to have an area in the city where we ban smoking but
would allow e-cigarettes,"" Coun. Tiffany Paulsen told her colleagues.

City administrators had recommended simply regulating e-cigarettes through the
no-smoking policy, but committee members voted unanimously for the city to go
further in regulating the battery powered devices, which simulate the experience
of smoking a cigarette.

Council as a whole is expected to vote on the issue Thursday afternoon.

Dr. Michael Schwandt, deputy medical health officer for the Saskatoon Health
Region, urged councillors to regulate e-cigarettes the same way they regulate
cigarettes.

""Consistency in a smokefree policy is key,"" he told councillors.

He said the long-term health risks of using ecigarettes or being exposed to
their vapour remain unknown and that unregulated vaping is ""re-normalizing""
smoking in public places.

The city began looking into e-cigarette regulations following complaints about
people vaping on Saskatoon transit buses. City administration said bus drivers
are asking people using ecigarettes on buses to stop, but no rules oblige them
to do so.

While changes to the nosmoking bylaw can be made quickly, city administrators
said that changing the bylaw will take much more time.

Coun. Pat Lorje urged speed on the issue.

""This is a matter of health and I think we should be implementing this as
quickly as possible,"" she told staff.

Why politicians go berserk over e-cigarettes

BYLINE: Karen Selick

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 697 words","


Just mention the phrase ""electronic cigarettes"" and politicians at every level
seem to go berserk. ""Holy non-smokes!"", they cry. ""We can't allow something new
and unregulated to exist in the marketplace! People might just solve their own
problems without us!""

From its infancy in 2003, the market for e-cigarettes has skyrocketed. It is now
estimated to be a $3.5 billion dollar business worldwide. As someone who hates
being accosted by sidestream smoke from burning tobacco sticks, I welcome this
development. In fact, I recently spent about 90 minutes in a ""vape shop"",
meeting with several vaping entrepreneurs. Even though two or three people were
vaping nearby throughout the meeting, I experienced no discomfort. All I noticed
was a slight, pleasant, fruity aroma in the air when I walked into the shop. Had
people been consuming equivalent amounts of tobacco sticks in that space, I
wouldn't have been able to spend two minutes there without starting to cough and
gasp for air.

Indeed, scientific studies confirm that there is virtually no risk to bystanders
from second-hand vapour, unlike second-hand tobacco smoke.

The vapers I met were former tobacco smokers themselves. E-cigarettes had let
them wean themselves off tobacco. Thousands (perhaps millions) of people are
doing the same. This was more news to gladden my heart. I hate paying taxes to
support the huge medical expenses caused by tobacco-related cancers and chronic
diseases - some $14 billion in Canada in 2012. It's not primarily the nicotine
that harms smokers; it's the tar and other chemical byproducts from burnt
tobacco.

Another pleasant surprise is that e-cigarettes are actually cheaper than tobacco
for vapers to get the same nicotine dose. This may be because governments impose
heavy taxes on tobacco products (about $7.3 billion per year in Canada), but
haven't yet geared up to extract similar amounts from the nicotine addicts who
have migrated to vaporizers. But for the addicts themselves, it is great news. A
disproportionate number of smokers are concentrated in the poorer segments of
society. If they can save money by substituting vaping for smoking, then they'll
have more money for other things. And if vaping helps them kick the habit
entirely, their finances will improve significantly.

But despite all these clear advantages of the vaping revolution, governments
have dug in their heels, seemingly determined to bring it to a screeching halt.
Major cities including Vancouver and Calgary have adopted bylaws discouraging
vaping. New Brunswick has had legislation hindering vaping since July, 2015. And
Ontario has enacted discouraging legislation which was originally supposed to be
implemented on Jan. 1, 2016 but has been temporarily deferred.

Federally, the Standing Committee on Health issued a report in March, 2015
recommending stringent regulation of vaping.

Since 2009, Health Canada has taken the position that e-cigarettes containing
nicotine are illegal. But out on the streets, Health Canada is simply being
ignored. There's a brisk trade in vaping supplies including nicotine.

Much of the new legislation might be found unconstitutional if challenged in the
courts. Nicotine addicts who still use tobacco as a delivery method are
suffering harm to their health that now appears to be quite unnecessary. Any
government that prevents them from accessing a cost-effective harm-reduction
product is probably infringing upon their Charter right to security of the
person. That was, after all, the heart of the argument in the Insite safe drug
injection case decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2011: Individuals have
a right to harm-reduction.

Unlike Insite, where the government had to provide highly-regulated personnel to
supervise addicts, smokers have been switching to vaping of their own
initiative. Frequently, the entrepreneurs who guide them are empathetic
fellow-travellers, despite being profit-seeking businesses. Vapers are looking
after their own well-being and promoting the well-being of others into the
bargain.

And the free market - much reviled among nanny state politicos - is making it
all possible.

Selangor mulls vape ban

BYLINE: Mazlinda Mahmood; Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah

LENGTH: 681 words","


SHAH ALAM: SELANGOR is likely to follow the footsteps of Penang, Kedah, Johor
and Kelantan in banning vaping devices and e-cigarettes in the state. However,
the state will continue to allow the sale and use of vaping devices until
Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Azmin Ali makes a decision on Jan 13.

State Health, Welfare, Women and Family Affairs executive councillor Dr Daroyah
Alwi said based on the recommendation made by the Health Ministry and the
conclusion reached by muftis nationwide on Dec 21, the state government and the
Selangor mufti may follow the National Fatwa Council's decision.

Present at the briefing were representatives from local councils licensing and
enforcement departments, Selangor Islamic Religious Department, Selangor Islamic
Religious Council, Selangor Mufti Office, state Education Department and state
legal adviser.

The briefing is a prelude to a workshop on vape to be held from Jan 11 to 12,
after which the state government is expected to make their stand on the matter.

Dr Daroyah said they were given a comprehensive briefing by the Health
Department. The most worrying aspect brought up, she said, was the dangers of
e-juice, apart from the increasing popularity of vaping among teenagers and even
schoolchildren.

""There are many components that can be added into e-juices, even though the
basic components of propylene glycol, glycerine, distilled water and flavour
seem 'innocent'.

""There are also nicotine concentrate, which is addictive, and additives, which
could be anything, including drugs,"" she said.

She pointed out that there was also a misconception that vaping was safer than
smoking cigarettes, but this was not true as the nicotine content and additives
added into e-juices were unknown.

""Sharing e-cigarettes or vaping devices can also spread communicable diseases
via saliva like herpes and hepatitis. We were also informed that 60 carcinogens
have been detected in the vapour of e-cigarettes.""

She revealed that Malaysia is the world's main supplier of e-juice and produced
8,000 flavours which are exported worldwide.

For now, the local councils have been asked to freeze the issuance of new
licences to vape entrepreneurs. So far, 69 licences were issued, including 30
temporary licences to vape entrepreneurs in Selangor.

In Seremban, Negri Sembilan mufti Datuk Mohd Yusof Ahmad said they would comply
with the National Fatwa Council's decision, and would officially ban vaping
after the state Fatwa Committee meeting next month.

""Vaping can cause more harm than good and should be prevented before it becomes
deadly,"" he said.

In Kota Baru, Kelantan, the state government will meet the Malay Vape Traders
Association next week to discuss its call for the authorities to extend the
dateline for all vape shops to cease business on Jan 1. State Local Government,
Housing and Sports Committee chairman Datuk Abdul Fattah Mahmood said the
meeting was to enable both parties to solve the issue.

""However, they have not sent me an official letter for the meeting and I only
knew about it in the press. I will contact them next week,"" he said here
yesterday.

Last week, the state government issued a ban on vape-related businesses
effective Jan 1.  Vape shop operators in the state have been given 14 days,
starting from Dec 16, to cease their activities.

In George Town, the Penang government said it would follow the Federal
Government by banning vaping in designated smoke-free zones. Health Committee
chairman Dr Afif Bahardin said a dialogue on vaping will be held on Jan 5 in
Komtar here.

""There is no firm stand on the matter with no ban on any form of e-cigarettes
nationwide from the Health Ministry. So, as a local administration, we will need
to decide,"" he said.

Deputy Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahaya said the ministry was mulling
over enforcing the current laws of Control of Tobacco Products Regulations 2004
by prohibiting the usage of vaping devices and e-cigarettes in 21 smoke-free
designated zones next year.

""The word 'vapour' will be added into the law and it will be effective once the
amendment is done,"" he said.

`Vape' community endures growing pains

KANSAS CITY - Like many a hard-core smoker, Candi McCann found it a bear to
quit. Nothing worked. Not the patch. Not those blue smoking cessation pills her
doctor prescribed.

Then she tried those electronic cigarettes that produce a steamy vapor instead
of smoke. Click, just like that, she went from more than a pack of smokes a day
to becoming the Kansas City area's leading vaping evangelist.

Finally shed of her 21-year smoking habit, the 42-year-old McCann now preaches
about the latest vaping gear on her YouTube channel. She helps organize ""vape
meets of fellow enthusiasts through the Fountain City Vapor Club. And more
recently she has turned her passion into a full-time job, hiring on as manager
at the Vapor World store near her home in Lenexa, Kansas.

""April 9, 2012, that's my vape-versery, she said, taking a drag from a
mouthpiece sticking out of a boxy contraption in her palm that was about the
size of an eyeglass case.

""I'm not going to tell you this is healthy, said McCann. ""But I can tell you
that it is 99 percent better for you than smoking.

Whether that stat is true or not, that's one selling point that keeps customers
coming back to the more than three dozen vape shops that have set up in the
metro area since 2013. Before, there were few or none.

Then there's the social aspect that has seen some vaping stores, like Waldo
Vapes, becoming something akin to java-free coffee shops, where people gather to
shoot the breeze, play games and challenge each other to see who can blow out
the biggest cloud of scented vapor.

""It's becoming a community, Levi Fields, a 20-year-old student at the culinary
school at Johnson County Community College, said as he took a toke in Waldo
Vapes' living-room-like setting. ""It's getting really, really big.

Supporters see e-cigarettes as a godsend for people trying to reduce or quit
smoking, which kills 480,000 Americans a year, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

But the trend concerns some health advocates. Scientists don't yet know much
about the health effects of electronic cigarettes, which are largely unregulated
and the subject of competing claims.

Critics also contend vaping is trading one form of addiction for another and
that the safer-than-cigarettes claims are convincing teens to adopt a nicotine
habit they might not have otherwise.

""It is a way to get kids addicted to nicotine, said Sue Matson, substance abuse
prevention coordinator at the Johnson County Mental Health Department. ""I'm
concerned about the possibility of renormalizing behavior that we have spent a
long time getting away from.

As the federal Food and Drug Administration weighs those arguments in advance of
imposing greater regulatory control, there is no debating this: Vaping has gone
mainstream in the last couple of years, spawning a more than $3 billion-a-year
industry in the United States. Two-thirds of sales are online, but increasingly
there are brick-and-mortar stores like the dozens of outlets that have been
cropping up across the nation.

You've seen them on street corners and in strip centers with names like KC
Vapes, Vape Up, Vape Room and CigaWatt.

Until recently, e-cigarettes were synonymous with the cigarette look-a-likes
sold alongside regular smokes in gas station convenience stores - ""cig-a-likes,
they're called. Marketed by Big Tobacco, they are an acceptable alternative to
smoking for many smokers, while others dismiss brands like Blu, Vuze and Njoy as
unsatisfying substitutes for the real thing.

But that is not the segment seeing the biggest growth and getting the most buzz.
Instead, it's the refillable ""open system vaping product category that is
driving an industry that within a decade, one prominent Wall Street analyst
predicts, will see more Americans vaping than smoking tobacco.

Open systems allow users to customize their vaping experience.

They can choose among a wide array of flavored liquids - from
bubble-gum-flavored to hazelnut butter cream - each of which has various levels
of nicotine to none at all. Drops of that ""e-juice are dripped into
battery-powered gadgets that look nothing like cigarettes.

They range from rechargeable vaping pens, called that because they look like
writing instruments and cost about $25 for a starter kit, to so-called modified
systems. Mods, for short, are built from mix-and-match components that can cost
as little as $40 to as much as a few hundred dollars. The price goes up along
with the wattage options. The more power, the more vapor.

Customers range in motivation, too. Some stop in only when they need to feed
their nicotine habit.

""They buy their juice coils once a week and go about their day, McCann said.

But there is also a dedicated bunch who consider themselves hobbyists. They
enjoy sampling different flavors and buying better and more expensive vaping
equipment.

And yet as big as vaping has become in a short amount of time, it's far from
being widely accepted outside the subculture that has grown up around it.

Which is why shop owners like Jonathan Brower, owner of Waldo Vapes, are wary of
and bracing for new rules that are sure to come down the pike eventually.

""People have a hard time wrapping their head around the fact that we're not
smoking anything, he said.

There may not be smoke, but local, state and federal officials are fired up
about the need to regulate e-cigarettes.

Overland Park and Columbia, for example, are among a number of local communities
that have extended prohibitions already imposed on smoking to vaping. It's not
allowed in indoor public spaces, confounding smokers who had been vaping in bars
rather than stepping outside to light up.

That makes it hard sometimes for the 800-member Fountain City Vapor Club to rent
space for its occasional meets, McCann said.

""The meets we hold every few months are free to attend, she said. ""We invite
local shops to set up tables. There are usually raffle and door prizes.

Also, both Missouri and Kansas are among the states that forbid the sale of
e-cigarettes and vaping gear to minors, a restriction that local vaping store
operators welcome.

""The main thing we're fighting now is we're getting a lot of minors trying to
buy, said Aaron Todd, who owns the Vapur of KC store and is part owner of two
other Vapur stores in the area. ""I even had one kid come in with his dad, point
out what he wanted and slide his dad a $20 bill, and I wouldn't sell it to him.

More than anything, it's that concern for minors that is driving opposition
locally and nationally.

A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the
use of e-cigarettes by teenagers had risen sharply, with 13 percent of high
schoolers reportedly using them in 2014.

At the same time, though, the number of high school smokers had dropped from 16
percent in 2011 to 9 percent in 2014.

""They [teenagers] believe it's a safe alternative because that's what they are
being told, said Kevin Kufeldt, who runs a regional drug treatment center that
serves adolescents from across Kansas.

To dissuade teens and their parents from vaping, Tri-County Mental Health
Services in the Northland plans to begin sending out public service
announcements through social media this summer.

The theme, said Tri-County's Reshana Peterson, is ""about the fact that nicotine
is nicotine.

To vape or not to vape? More and more just say no ...;
Use of e-cigarettes levels off as firms pour millions into marketing

BYLINE: Jamie Doward

SECTION: SOCIETY

LENGTH: 806 words","


The sight of colleagues and acquaintances taking a drag on an e-cigarette has
become commonplace. But have we reached ""peak vape""?

Statistics suggest that vaping among smokers and recent ex-smokers, who comprise
the vast majority of vapers, may already be on the decline. The figures will be
studied closely by the major e-cigarette firms, which have poured millions into
promoting a technology that was thought to have been growing in popularity.

Figures released last year by the health charity Ash reveal that usage among
adults in Britain of electronic cigarettes - which do not contain tobacco and
produce vapour, not smoke - has tripled over the past two years from an
estimated 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in 2014.

However, figures collated by the Smoking Toolkit Study, a research body backed
by the Department of Health that provides quarterly updates on smoking trends,
show vaping's appeal may be waning. Vaping rates among smokers and ex-smokers
rose steadily until the end of 2013, when some 22% of smokers and ex-smokers
were vaping. But this proportion levelled out throughout 2014 before dropping to
19% during the final quarter of last year. Early signs suggest the decline has
continued into 2015.

The drop is described as ""statistically significant"" by Professor Robert West,
of UCL's Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, who collates the figures
for the Toolkit.

Smokers are the key group for e-cigarette firms because seven out of 10 vapers
are smokers. Only around 1% of people who have never smoked have tried an
electronic cigarette.

""Numbers who use them [e-cigarettes] while continuing to smoke are going down,""
West said. ""We've only been tracking it [vaping] for just over a year, so it's a
short time period, but we are not seeing growth in the number of long-term
ex-smokers or 'never' smokers using e-cigarettes. That is not to say it [vaping
rates] might not change, but at this stage it looks like it's staying the same.""

The levelling off in popularity of vaping would appear to be at odds with what
is happening in the US, where the technology has been promoted aggressively and
where, earlier this month, reports suggested it was growing in popularity.
However, West questioned the interpretation of US data which made little
distinction between people who had once tried an e-cigarette and those who
regularly vaped.

Fears that vaping could become fashionable among young non-smokers appear to be
misplaced, according to experts. Only 1.8% of children are regular users, the
Ash study found. Instead e-cigarettes seem to be most popular among adults
seeking to quit.

""While the figures published this month by Smoking In England show that the use
of electronic cigarettes by smokers has levelled off, their data also shows the
huge increase in use since May 2011,"" said James Dunworth, director and
co-founder of ecigarettedirect.co.uk. ""Our customers are still very happy with
the product, and technology and innovation in hardware is improving user
experience and helping them to switch from traditional cigarettes.""

""E-cigarettes are behaving like a souped-up nicotine patch,"" West agreed. ""They
are more popular than nicotine patches and may or may not be more effective.
One-third of quit attempts use e-cigarettes which makes them by far the most
popular method of stopping.""

Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy at Ash, said it was too soon to say whether
vaping had peaked. ""Although there are indications that the market hasn't grown
in the UK for about a year, there doesn't seem to be a decline in the number of
people using electronic cigarettes to help them quit smoking. Using an
electronic cigarette is safer than smoking; some, but not all, people find them
useful to help quit smoking and there is little evidence that they are leading
to an increase in young people smoking.""

Last week it emerged that the European commission is looking at increasing taxes
on e-cigarettes, something that could have an impact on their popularity. A new
EC tobacco directive comes into force next year that will limit the amount of
nicotine in e-cigarettes to below their current levels. This may mean vapers
will have to increase their usage to obtain the same hit, again something that
may make e-cigarettes more expensive.

West suggested that policymakers should see e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation
aid and not subject them to the same regulations as smoking.

""There is a tendency among some local authorities and organisations to treat
e-cigarettes as cigarettes and ban them in public places and outdoors,"" he said.
""The problem is that brings public health into disrepute. It just sounds like
you're having a go at vapers and hitting everyone with a sledgehammer and that
undermines the public health messages we're trying to get out. We have to be
careful not to stigmatise e-cigarettes.""

TheVapeTrader.com Fills Market Niche as Vaping Becomes Overwhelmingly Popular

LENGTH: 462  words","


May 12 -- With Vaping taking over in the social scene, we can see how this
industry is one of the fastest-growing businesses in America. With more than
3,500 independent vape shops around the country and a plethora of virtual online
vape stores on the web such as http://thevapetrader.com, sales are projecting
over $3 billion within the next five years. Vaping isn't just a business, it is
also a lifestyle and is quickly becoming a hobby. With limited edition e-cig
mods such as the Surefire Vapors King, they are becoming quite collectable. This
leaves wanting vapors looking to buy them once they have been sold out at retail
locations. So, where do these hobbyists buy, sell, or trade these sought-out
collectibles? On http://thevapetrader.com. It is one of the fastest-growing vape
classified ad sites in the world. The Vape Trader brings buyers and sellers from
the vaping community together to help them buy, sell or trade their vape-related
items. TheVapeTrader.com has been called, ""The 'Craigslist' of the vaping
community,"" by Mike, a user on the site's reviews. Like all collectibles, people
enjoy owning items for a certain length of time until something new catches
their eye. Then, they try to sell or trade their unwanted item for another and
http://thevapetrader.com provides that gateway for them.



TheVapeTrader.com is filling a niche in the market by providing users a platform
to connect buyers, sellers, and traders around the world. The site is simple to
use and comparable to Craigslist but is strictly for the e-cig industry. They
only allow vaporizer products geared towards e-liquid, a flavored liquid
nicotine, and steer away from the e-cig type vaporizers created for marijuana
products. ""I created the site to bring people together and help them find that
coveted item,"" says George, the owner of TheVapeTrader.com. For anyone who would
like to take part in the vaping community TheVapeTrader.com has a online forum
that allows users to get together and have a conversation or gain general
knowledge about vaping. The Vape Trader also has a large community following on
Instagram that offers vape-related giveaways by sharing posts and tagging with
@TheVapeTrader. ""We take pride in giving back to our users,"" says George. He
mentions that, ""We wouldn't have a company without them and we want to show our
appreciation for their support.""

http://thevapetrader.com is helping build a community that is about camaraderie
by having something in common with others while allowing them to buy, sell, or
trade vape items. While vaping with friends socially is becoming something very
common these days, The Vape Trader strives to provide that same experience
online by bringing people together through its website and other social
networking outlets.

Darth vaper or flavor savior? Bemidji businessman fighting to keep vaping lounge

Oct. 19--BEMIDJI -- As autumn inches closer to winter and raindrops become
snowflakes, it won't be long before we can see our breath when we exhale
outdoors.

Northern Vapes owner Matt Bewley described vaping as a similar experience.

""Vaping"" has been gaining popularity the past few years. What started out as a
nicotine delivery system that cut out the harmful effects of smoking to a user
and second-hand smoke to non-smokers has morphed into its own subculture.

""People can visit in vaping lounges like they do in coffee shops,"" Bewley said.

While the new smoke-free way to kick back is praised by some, it may be
short-lived in Bemidji. The Bemidji City Council and Beltrami County board are
in the process of amending their tobacco ordinances to include e-cigarettes and
e-devices. If one proposed change is enacted, prohibiting sampling in vaping
lounges, Bewley's customers will have a much different experience.

""Customers sample without nicotine,"" Bewley said. ""In Duluth, they made it so
they can't sample at all. I don't think I've sold a unit yet where someone
didn't sample first.""

Bewley acknowledges there needs to be regulations in place to protect people,
but no concrete studies have shown that the vapor emitted from e-cigs is
harmful. All of Bewley's products are pharmaceutical grade, he said.

Yes, nicotine can cause birth defects, reproductive harm, increased heart rate
and accelerated blood pressure, as indicated by Marti Lundin, program manager
for the American Lung Association, who presented to the Beltrami County Board
work session on Tuesday.

Bewley said people know what they're walking into when they come into his shop.
You must be at least 18-years-old and show identification. He feels it should be
up to the business owner to decide what can and cannot be allowed within their
walls.

Bemidji's first vaping lounge, Northern Vapes, opened two months ago. Bewley
said business has been picking up by word of mouth advertising. Northern Vapes
sells both devices and flavored ""e-juice"" cartridges.

Personal vaporizers, e-cigarettes or vapers are two- or three-piece devices that
consist of a lithium ion battery that powers the device, a heating unit that
vaporizes e-juice and a unit that holds the liquid. Two-piece e-cigs have a
combined liquid cartridge and atomizer.

Different people vape for different reasons. Some enjoy the sensation of smoking
without the smoke. Others are trying to wean themselves off of nicotine
completely.

On Friday afternoon, one of Northern Vapes regular customers, Josh, was enjoying
a toke on his lunch break in a sleek black leather chair as he looked out onto
Minnesota Avenue.

""People think it's a head shop. It's not,"" Josh said. Josh is a former smoker
who switched to clove cigarettes and now is content with vaping.

A former pack-a-day cigarette smoker, Bewley tried one of the cigarette-looking
devices he ordered off the Internet. Within three days, he converted from smoker
to vaper.

""I'm not getting rich here,"" Bewley said. ""It worked for me. I just want to help
people.""

A person who smokes a pack of cigarettes a day spends roughly $60 a week on
cigarettes. Bewley said vaping e-cigarettes costs about $15 a week.

Having a physical shop in a community provides customers with the opportunity to
consult with a person who has researched the devices and is knowledgeable on the
product, he said. Bewley has repaired devices for his customers and is available
to make dosage recommendations based on a person's needs. Smokers who are trying
to quit cigarettes and smoke regular strength will usually start with a stronger
dosage and work their way down.

Bewley said regular cigarettes contain up to 4,000 ingredients, including
chemicals and carcinogens whereas the liquid he sells contains up to four:
vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine and flavoring.

E-juice comes in a range of nicotine strengths as high as 24 milligrams (mg) to
zero mg. People who sample in Northern Vapes are sampling a nicotine-free
version of the flavor they buy.

""You'd think people would welcome it with open arms to get rid of cigarettes,""
Bewley said.

The Bemidji City Council will be reading a proposed revision to its ordinance at
their meeting Monday. Bewley has invited council members, county commissioners
and law enforcement to Northern Vapes. He said a few council members took him up
on the offer.

Corporate: Whither this business of vaping?

BYLINE: Adeline Paul Raj

LENGTH: 2348 words","


The estimated RM2 billion vaping industry in Malaysia, which is believed to be
the second largest in the world after the US, is huge and growing far too
rapidly for the government to ignore.

The relatively new but unregulated industry â "" spanning retailers, brewers of
the vape liquid and distributors â "" is booming after a particularly explosive
year in 2014, which players say was fuelled by a surge in demand as an
increasing number of smokers turn to vaping. Vaping refers to the use of
electronic cigarettes.

â  The industry has reached what we call a tipping point,â  says Samsul Kamal
Arrifin, president of the Malaysian Organisation of Vape Entities (MOVE), which
considers itself a consumer rights movement group for the vaping industry. It is
one of two bodies in the country that represent the industry, the other being
the Malaysian E-Vaporizers and Tobacco Alternative Association

Ironically, despite its rapid growth, the vaping industry falls under a grey
area given that liquid nicotine â "" one of the four ingredients used in making
vape liquids â "" is a controlled substance, regulated under the 1952 Poisons
Act, and can only be sold through licensed pharmacists and medical
practitioners.

Entrepreneurs first started bringing vape products into Malaysia in 2011, when
vaping was at the infancy stage, although some say products were already
available on a limited and hard-to-find basis even before that.

Samsul says local retailers and brewers have since mushroomed across the nation,
especially in the Klang Valley, drawn to the high margins the business offers.
New ones seem to be popping up by the day and itâ  s all getting â  a bit out of
controlâ . There needs to be some form of regulation, he says, pointing out that
it is something that the serious players and most consumers themselves want.

There are no official statistics on the size of the vaping industry or the
number of vapers in Malaysia. On its estimated size, different numbers have been
bandied about in various media reports, with the most conservative estimate at
RM500 million.

Samsul is convinced itâ  s a much bigger market than that. Based on his
observation and close rapport with some of the players, he estimates that it was
a US$500 million market last year, and that it will likely double this year. â
I think it will continue to grow at this pace for the next two to three years,
unless, of course, vaping is banned. But even then, the industry is unlikely to
die ... it will just go underground. I think by the end of this year, total
sales in the industry will be in the region of US$1 billion and in the next
year, it could double that.â

He estimates that there are 400,000 to 500,000 vapers in the country, who spend
RM300 to RM500 a month on average to support the habit. Many of these vapers are
smokers who have turned to vaping as a means to eventually quit smoking, while
for others, especially youngsters, it is a recreational pursuit. Malaysia
reportedly has 4.7 million smokers.

Samsul believes there are around 200 brewers, of which 50 to 60 are key players.
There are 4 to 5 major distributors of the products. As for retailers, there
could be around 1,000 vape retailers nationwide, he says.

â  Itâ  s crazy money. Brewers, the successful ones, make RM100,000 to RM200,000
in net profit a month. And this is just a conservative estimate. The
distributors make a lot more,â  he remarks.

The industry has already spawned several young millionaires, he says.

To put things in perpective, British American Tobacco Malaysia Bhd (BAT), the
biggest of three cigarette makers here, raked in RM4.8 billion in revenue and
net profit of RM898.1 million last year.

Considering that the government derived some RM3.5 billion in revenue from the
legal tobacco industry last year, the question that needs to be asked is â ""
why, especially at a time when the governmentâ  s coffers are tight, does it not
also impose taxation on the vaping industry, given how it is likely to grow,
with or without government regulation?

As the industry is huge, the government is losing out big on potential revenue.
According to Samsul, most players and consumers are agreeable to regulations
that include taxation.

Given its lucrativeness, industry sources say one or two well-known businessmen
with political connections are positioning themselves to be a part of the vaping
industry once it is eventually regulated.

Government stance

If Malaysia moves to regulate the vaping industry, which it indicated it will in
an Oct 30 statement issued by the Health Ministry â "" although there have been
conflicting signals sent out since then â "" it will be the first among its
closest neighbours in Asia to do so.

Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and Hong Kong already have an outright ban on vape
products, while Indonesia has indicated it is going for a ban too.

In the Oct 30 statement, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam said the
Cabinet had deliberated on the vaping climate and culture in the country and
recognised that there was a need to educate the public on the effects of
e-cigarettes and for strongent regulation. He said both measures would be
implemented immediately by the ministry.

A few days later, a MoH official issued a statement, saying â  until there is
enough evidence that the benefits of electronic cigarettes outweigh the harmful
effectsâ , MoH was â  very much inclined towards prohibiting them as stipulated
by the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the
International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseaseâ .

But then, last Thursday, according to a local daily, Dr Subramaniam said the
government was looking at imposing excise duty for e-cigarettes â "" a form of
regulation, which seems to suggest that it wonâ  t be banned.

â  If cigarettes are charged excise duty, it can be too for e-cigarettes. We are
looking at it legally,â  Subramaniam was quoted as saying.

He also said that for now, shops selling nicotine-based vape liquids must apply
for a permit from the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau. â  If they do not
have a permit, then they are committing an offence, and we can take action
against them,â  he said, pointing out that the liquids comes under the Poisons
Act.

Vape shops owners were up in arms as the ministry raided 50 to 60 shops
nationwide, mainly in the Klang Valley last Thursday, confiscating the liquids.
Most vape liquids contain some measure of liquid nicotine.

MoH officials did not respond to requests for comment.

No one regulation model

But how does one regulate the industry? Samsul concedes it will be a Herculean
task to get it regulated in a way that benefits both the government and the
industry/consumers. It will require legislation and effective enforcement to
work.

The countries that have regulated vaping so far include Italy, Spain, and
Germany. In the UK, the sale and use of e-cigarettes are legal, while in the US,
there are no federal regulations as yet although many states already have their
own regulations.

â  There are regulation models out there but the vaping climate in each country
is not the same; each has its own specific issues to address. So, while we can
learn from them, we canâ  t really do a copy-and-paste job,â  he explains.

Regulation will have to address the governmentâ  s two key concerns about the
vaping industry â "" under-18 users, and the safety aspect of the vape liquids.
As of now, given how the industry has flourished, there is concern over what may
go into the liquids, if the ingredients sourced are of good quality and safe for
consumption, and if they are brewed under hygienic conditions.

In a nutshell, the regulation has to cover three aspects â "" the manufacturing
of vape liquids and â  modsâ  (as the e-cigarette device is referred to), the
selling of the products and the consumers.

â  But vaping as a whole needs to be defined legally first. Once it is legally
defined, only then we can see where it actually fits into our current laws. If
it falls under the Tobacco Act, then it has to follow tobacco-like taxation. But
how can this be a tobacco product when thereâ  s no actual tobacco in it? So, we
think it should fall somewhere between a pharmaceutical and tobacco product â ""
hence, a â  foodâ   product. Either that, or they should come up with a new Act
to regulate taxation for this product,â  Samsul says.

In Italy, thereâ  s a controversial â  supertaxâ  imposed on vaping. According
to reports, the tax assesses 1ml of vaping fluid to about five cigarettes.
Post-regulation, the industry today is apparently only a quarter the size it
once was, by some estimates.

As such, some industry observers say regulation, particularly over-regulation,
may naturally reduce the size of the Malaysian industry. Others, however, think
it will result in a thriving black market.

Samsul says MOVE, in a memorandum presented to the MoH last month, proposed
consumer-driven regulation. â  When it comes to manufacturing of liquids, we are
proposing for brewers to have a Good Manufacturing Practice system. Your
operation must be audited. You must clearly state where your ingredients are
from, and it must be food-grade ingredients (as opposed to industrial grade).
The liquid nicotine must be supplied by an authorised body.â

As for taxation, he says itâ  s best for the government to tax at the point the
nicotine is sold to the brewers. And as for retailers, by having to apply for
licences, the number of players would be reduced from what it is now, making it
easier for the government to keep an eye on them.

Labelling of vape liquid bottles also needs to be regulated. â  The labels need
to have certain warnings â "" like, not meant for under-18 users, and the
ingredients and level of nicotine content, and grade of contents, need to be
clearly specified.

â  There are usually four ingredients found in vape liquids â "" propylene glycol
and vegetable glycerine which are widely used in making ice cream and cakes, as
well as some flavouring and liquid nicotine.â

While many users see vaping as the best alternative to smoking, there continues
to be mixed opinions as to how it impacts health. There is no conclusive
evidence as to how it might impact health over the long term.

A study commissioned by Public Health England in the UK this year found that
best estimates show e-cigarettes to be 95% less harmful to health than normal
cigarettes. And, when supported by a smoking cessation service, it helps most
smokers to quit tobacco altogether.

Threat to cigarettes?

Contrary to popular belief, cigarette manufacturers are not against the vaping
industry despite the threat it is said to pose to their own business. Two of the
local players tell The Edge they support appropriate regulation for
e-cigarettes.

Industry sources say with some of the big global cigarette makers having started
to penetrate the e-cigarette market since 2012, it wouldnâ  t be surprising if
their Malaysian units did the same once the industry is regulated.

In August, BAT Plc formed an alliance with Reynolds American Inc to share vapour
technology and licensing, and agreed to buy Polish e-cigarette maker Chic Group
to expand its e-cigarette product range.

â  The issue of e-cigarettes has been one of the great debates in public health
in recent years with many health professionals and experts issuing supportive
research and views. We too believe that these products have the potential to
positively impact public health and we therefore support a regulatory framework
that gives consumers the assurances they deserve around product quality, safety
and availability,â  BAT Malaysiaâ  s managing director Stefano Clini says in an
email response to The Edge.

He points out that BAT Malaysia currently does not manufacture or sell
e-cigarettes. â  However, BAT Group is committed to harm reduction and as such,
in 2013, BAT was the first to launch an e-cigarette, Vype, in the UK and
recently in Florence too,â  he adds.

Meanwhile, Philip Morris Malaysia Sdn Bhd corporate affairs director Ozan
Ibrisim says, â  Philip Morris Malaysia supports appropriate regulations for all
tobacco propducts and e-cigarettes and we believe these products should be
restricted to adults above the age of 18.â

UOB Kay Hian Research, in a report on the Malaysian tobacco industry on Oct 12,
says while it believes the e-cigarette market will continue to grow, it doesnâ
t pose a serious threat to the traditional cigarette market in the near term.
Among the reasons it cites is that the majority of smokers still prefer the
taste of regular cigarettes and the fact that e-cigarettes are not significantly
cheaper.

A one-time investment in a China-made â  modâ  in Malaysia can cost as low as
about RM200, while a 30ml bottle of locally-made vape liquid costs around RM40.

â  In our view, the canibalisation of traditional cigarette sales due to
e-cigarettes is still minimal at this juncture,â  it says, adding that declines
in legal volumes of late was mainly because smokers went for cheaper contraband
cigarettes after excise duty was raised last year.

Last week, the industry was hit with another round of excise duty hike â "" this
time, by a sharp 40% or so, resulting in BAT raising its prices by between 22%
and 26% a pack.

Clini says BAT Malaysia is unable to determine the impact the vape industry on
domestic cigarette volumes given that the industry is relatively new and there
are no official statistics on its size.

â   We are of the view that the decrease (in legal volumes) was largely driven
by the softer demand among consumers due to weaker market sentiment after GST
implementation. In addition, the tobacco industryâ  s legal volumes are also
impacted by the high level of illegal cigarettes which is currently at 33.7%,â
he says.

Meanwhile, industry players say it may take a long time before the government
actually comes out with any effective form of regulation. Until then, the
industry will likely continue to grow, although more retailers may opt for
online platforms as the raids on their outlets continue.

It will be interesting to see how things play out over the next few weeks.

Brisk sales of used devices on Facebook

SECTION: Pg. 6

LENGTH: 325 words","


KUALA TERENGGANU: Some 25,000 vape users in the state are frantically selling
off their devices through social media.

This is after the state government's announcement that vaping is haram
(forbidden).

Checks showed that at least two Facebook pages have been set up as a platform
for vape users to sell their used devices.

Their target market are basically new users in states where vaping is yet to be
banned or unlikely to be banned.

To ensure their device could be sold off as soon as possible, they have slashed
their price by up to 50 per cent.

A new vaping device costs at least RM150.

Terengganu Malay Vape Traders Association president Mohd Kamaruzaman Mahmud said
many users had initially approached vape traders, from whom they bought their
vape devices, for help to dispose them.

He said the requests were rejected as the traders themselves had to dispose off
their own stocks.

""As vaping is banned in the state, we have turned down their request as there is
no way for us to help them sell their devices in the state.

""Ever since the Facebook pages were created, I was informed that hundreds of
second-hand vaping device changed hands daily.

""Besides new users from other states, buyers of second-hand vaping devices are
mainly those who buy it as spare parts or as collectibles,"" he told the New
Straits Times.

It is learnt that some 100 vape traders in Terengganu are still in possession of
stocks worth at least RM5 million.

Last Sunday, the state government has extended a six-month grace period,
starting from Jan 1, for vape traders to dispose of their stocks.

Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Ahmad Razif Abdul Rahman said the grace period was for
them to dispose of existing stocks as the state government did not want the
traders to get into any financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, because of
unsold stocks.

He said a digital mall would be built in the city to help former vape traders
venture into new businesses after the grace period.

On the wall of Paul Clift-Lands's cafe is a photograph of an oil painting.
Painted in 1859, it depicts his great-grandmother as a small girl standing next
to some vivid red-and-white flowers. The colours employed by the artist are more
vivid in the photograph than in the original. The camera flash penetrated the
painting's thick yellow patina caused by exposure to more than a century of
tobacco smoke.

Enjoying a well-earned break in the lull before the lunchtime rush last Thursday
morning, Clift-Lands shakes his head as he recalls an era when smoking was the
norm. ""People forget what it was like in the 60s. You'd walk into any pub and
you'd be hit by the fug.""

Not any more. Smoking is on the way out, especially among the young. New figures
reveal that only 3% of 11- to 15-year-olds in England regularly smoke, compared
with 9% a decade ago.

Experts say the smoking ban has been crucial in denormalising tobacco use, but
Clift-Lands believes his Vaping Cafe in genteel Tunbridge Wells, the first in
the country when it opened last year, is playing its part. The impressive array
of e-cigarettes and vaporisers - the battery-powered gadgets that deliver
nicotine in bursts of different flavours via atomisers - that are on sale in his
shop are helping an increasing number of smokers to quit lighting up.

According to the health charity Ash, use of electronic cigarettes among adults
has tripled in Britain from an estimated 700,000 users in 2012 to 2.1 million in
2014. The fledgling industry has already cemented itself into the zeitgeist.
Everyone from Kevin Spacey's character in US political drama House of Cards to
Cara Delevingne, Johnny Depp, Snoop Dogg and dancers in a recent Lily Allen
video enjoy vaping.

But this brings fresh concerns. Some experts fear vaping will introduce children
to smoking. In addition, they fear that people who would never smoke are being
encouraged to cultivate an addiction to nicotine, a potentially deadly poison. A
lack of hard data makes drawing conclusions difficult. The British Medical
Association stresses the need for further research, saying that ""it's really
important that we find out if the hand-to-mouth use of e-cigarettes either
breaks or reinforces smoking behaviours"".

However, Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the health charity Ash, said the new
figures showing the decline in smoking among young people should assuage these
concerns. ""Some people have been worried that electronic cigarettes could be a
gateway into smoking for young people,"" Arnott said. ""The latest figures show
this has not happened so far. But we need to keep monitoring use in young people
and make sure advertising and promotion of electronic cigarettes doesn't
glamorise their use.""

After a year behind his counter, Clift-Lands, 52, a reformed smoker who started
smoking at age nine, has reached his own verdict. ""I walk down the street and I
see kids smoking cigarettes. It's a rite of passage. Nobody I know has gone from
vaping to cigarettes. If it wasn't available, kids would be on cigarettes
inhaling all the 70-odd carcinogens and everything else that comes with them.""

As he says this, two suspiciously young lads walk into his coffee shop.
Clift-Lands, who spent decades with the Metropolitan police, asks them for ID,
although there is no minimum age requirement for the purchase of e-cigarettes.
One of the boys explains that he is a smoker trying to give up. The other, who
doesn't smoke, explains: ""All my friends smoke. I don't want to smoke but I want
to fit in."" Do girls of their age vape? ""No, it's more boys. The girls like to
smoke.""

The boy hands over £ 40 in cash and receives a bewildering amount of liquids,
batteries, chargers and other paraphernalia that enable him to start vaping, or
""grazing"" as true aficionados call the act of inhaling vaporised nicotine. It
seems like a lot of money, but someone with a 20-a-day habit will need to spend
just £ 6 a week if they switch to vaping - considerably less than the price of
one packet of 20 cigarettes.

""Parents drag their children down here when they find out they've started
smoking,"" Clift-Lands says. He gestures at a whiteboard displaying prices and
strengths. ""They'd rather they did this than smoke.""

Andrew Davis, a barista and musician, comes in to stock up ahead of his holiday
to Turkey. He orders blueberry, vanilla, banana and grape flavours. ""Newbies
struggle,"" Clift-Lands admits. ""There's too much choice. I try to restrict it. I
offer around 25 flavours, but I could offer 50.""

The shop, close to a mosque, does a good trade with local Muslims who
particularly like the apple flavour. Clift-Lands favours the espresso flavour
first thing in the morning. He tried chocolate, but few of his regulars cared
for it. Cinnamon is popular at Christmas. Many people like to mix their flavours
to create their own vape cocktail.

Davis, 31, credits vaping with him stopping his 10-a-day cigarette addiction.
Like everyone who comes into the shop, he prefers the vaporisers rather than
e-cigarettes, the devices that look like cigarettes but offer only three
flavours. ""It's to do with the effect,"" Davis explains enthusiastically. ""With
vaporisers it's much more like the type of hit you get with a cigarette.""

There are concerns that insufficient research has been done into the
side-effects of vaping, especially the potentially harmful properties of glycol,
a bonding agent used in the vaporisation process. ""One of my regular clients is
a doctor,"" Clift-Lands says. ""He says even if there is something nasty in it,
it's not going to be as bad as cigarettes.""

He has a lot of customers in their sixties, keen to give up smoking. Many are
now regulars. He started off making around £ 300 a week and now takes more than
£ 1,000. It's not bad going for a small shop on an unloved road a little way
from the town centre.

This success has not gone unnoticed. Over the road from the Vaping Cafe stands
Totally Wicked, a vaping franchise imported from the US which has stores
throughout the south-east. Vaping cafes are mushrooming across the UK. There is
a land grab taking place analogous to the coffee shop market, where big
high-street brands buy up premises close to established independent cafes.
Clift-Lands says that he receives around 15 emails a day from people around the
world trying to sell him products. He buys only from UK distributors whose
product has been batch-tested by trading standards.

The market, he feels, is too fragmented. There are too many vaping devices using
different chargers and batteries. Below his counter sits a sizeable electronic
shisha pipe and a luxury wooden vaporiser resplendent in an attractive
presentation box. They are examples of a fast-developing market, one that has
caught big tobacco napping. The established cigarette giants have scrambled to
launch their own vaping brands, fearful that they are going to lose millions of
customers.

But the rapid rise of vaping could also be to its detriment. The Treasury would
be concerned if e-cigarettes cannibalised its tobacco revenues. Clift-Lands
grazes on his vaporiser and nods outside at the sign saying ""try for free"". He
exhales a short, sweet burst of vapour and shrugs. ""I give it two years before
they come for us.""

Oregon: KOIN 6: Should vaping in public go up in smoke?

LENGTH: 998  words","

DATELINE: Salem


Portland State University, The State of Oregon has issued the following News
release:

Whenever Michael Hamberg went to the Westfield Vancouver Mall, he'd see vapor
rising from the e-cigarette kiosk.

The kiosk attendants, he said, ""were always blowing vapors in the air."" He said
the vapor caused him throat irritation and he was worried about the impact on
his two young daughters.

""I was just kind of concerned about my family being there with the health
issues,"" he said.

He said he tried to contact the Westfield Vancouver Mall's management about the
issue, but ""I haven't got a response.""

The marketing director for the mall declined an interview and had no comment on
the topic when contacted by KOIN 6 News.

The owner of the Life-Wise Vapor kiosk in the mall also had no comment for KOIN
6 News.

The law

A young man vapes at a kiosk in the Westfield Vancouver Mall, December 2014
(KOIN 6 News)

Washington's law regarding smoking in public places passed in 2005. It does not
ban e-cigarettes, which appeared on the market about two years later.

The Washington Department of Health said it's up to local governments to make
the call about e-cigarettes. King, Pierce and Grant counties, plus Pasco City,
don't allow vaping indoors.

""Vancouver doesn't have that kind of ban,"" said Paul Davis of the tobacco
prevention control section of the Washington Department of Health. ""We do get a
number of calls asking why is it that people can use these products.""

An employee of the Life-Wise Vapor kiosk told KOIN 6 News some of the liquids
are infused with caffeine and melatonin.

Davis thinks that's a problem.

""I think when you have a chemical that people are inhaling into their lungs and
it's a psychoactive chemical and it doesn't have any regulation or any
protection or prevention for kids, that's a cause for concern.""

Proposed legislation

Flavored products for e-cigarettes, December 2014 (KOIN 6 News)

There are five proposed bills in Washington and seven in Oregon about vaping in
this upcoming legislative session. Most of those are about regulating
e-cigarettes to prevent minors from easily accessing them. (A list of the
proposed legislation is listed at the bottom of this article.)

But there is nothing in the proposed legislation to stop vaping indoors.

In Vancouver, the use of any tobacco product in a park is punishable by law with
a fine of up to $1,000.

Mayor Tim Leavitt told KOIN 6 News he just heard about the indoor vaping at the
Westfield Vancouver Mall and he said the city will now consider banning indoor
vaping.

""Our city manager has been tasked with doing some research,"" Leavitt said.

Clark County Councillor Tom Mielke had no idea vaping was allowed in the mall.
""I'm really surprised because that's an indoor area,"" he said.

Mielke told KOIN 6 News Clark County will likely pass an ordinance preventing
vaping in public places ""probably within a month or two.""

PSU Study

Portland State University professors Dr. James Pankow and Dr. David Peyton
published studies in the New England Journal of Medicine about vaping (KOIN 6
News)

Portland State University professors Dr. James Pankow and Dr. David Peyton
published studies in the New England Journal of Medicine about vaping.

Pankow studied flavor chemicals in vaping liquids and said they are not safe for
inhaling. In some of the liquids, the study found the flavorant level is very
high.

""Anyone who is around an e-cigarette user is being exposed to the same chemicals
as the user, and it's not just water vapor. It's all the chemicals and the
flavorants,"" Pankow told KOIN 6 News. ""It's a class of chemical, an aldehyde,
are known respiratory irritants.""

Peyton's study discovered a carcinogen.

""We saw up to 15 times as much formaldehyde as one study saw in cigarette
smoke,"" he said.

The researchers said they have found several more health concerns in
e-cigarettes and plan to publish more studies in the next few months.

KOIN 6 News asked several e-cigarette manufacturers about their products, but
they declined to be interviewed.

However, Phil Daman, the chairman and president of the Smoke-Free Alternatives
Trade Association, said he was familiar with the recent research.

""The study was in no way, shape or form designed to examine whether or not
electronic cigarettes were more harmful than smoking,"" Daman told KOIN 6 News.

The concerned parent

Michael Hamberg hopes the Vancouver city leaders follow suit so no vaping will
be inside the mall.

""It seems like a family environment like a mall, they shouldn't have something
like that,"" he said.

Letter: Vaping leads to nicotine addiction

SECTION: PUBLIC FORUM; News; Opinion

LENGTH: 208 words","


Yet again the games of thinly veiled falsehoods and misinformation are chosen as
the weapons of choice by the tobacco industry. In Tuesday's article, Gregory
Conley rejects that "" ccc we are going to have an entire culture of children
addicted to nicotine ccc ""

This is a glaring bait-and-switch in which he makes the inaccurate logical leap
from e-cigarettes as a gateway to cigarettes to the statement that kids are not
becoming addicted to nicotine by vaping. He and his tobacco-industry cohorts
insist that e-cigarettes are safe (they most certainly are not) and insinuates
that kids don't become nicotine addicts through vaping.

Fact: Vaping is a nicotine delivery system.

Fact: When exposed to nicotine, the developing brain is primed for addiction.

Fact: The younger a person is at initial nicotine exposure, the harder it is to
quit later in life, a reality that big tobacco and the vaping industry are well
aware of.

How best to halt the skid of tobacco use? Create new addictive products and hide
behind a barrage of mistruths and a culture of doubt. A new generation will
become addicted, and we will once again grapple with as yet unknown health care
and social consequences.

The year in e-cigarettes: The good, the bad, the reason for optimism

LENGTH: 1430  words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Enterprise Institute has issued the following news
release:



 As 2015 draws to a close, electronic cigarettes remain as controversial and as
poorly understood among the general public as they were a year ago. Are
e-cigarettes re-normalizing smoking? Are kids using them as a stepping stone to
combustible cigarettes? Do flavors lure teens? Are e-cigarettes as harmful as
the real thing? Are formaldehyde and other toxins a threat to vapers?





 The answer to all those questions is no. As documented here by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, teen smoking is at historic lows, despite--or perhaps
because of--an increasing number of teenagers experimenting with e-cigs. See
here the evidence that teens who do not smoke regular cigarettes are not
inclined to try e-cigs because of their flavors. See here for an explanation of
the oft-cited estimate that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than combustible
tobacco products. See here for evidence flatly debunking claims about
carcinogenic formaldehyde levels in e-cigs and here for information on lower
levels of other chemicals in e-cigs relative to standard cigarettes.



 But who could blame the average American for being skeptical of e-cigarettes'
benefits? People are barraged by daily sorties of disinformation. The two
biggest offenders in the crusade against e-cigarettes are the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and the California State Department of Health, whose campaign,
""Still Blowing Smoke"", critiqued here, gets a ""5-tar"" rating for being among the
most deceptive and biased public health announcements I have ever seen.

  As the year ends, CDC Director Frieden sets out priorities: ""Old and new
threats to our health, such as Ebola, dengue, HIV, e-cigarette use among kids,
foodborne illness, prescription drug overdoses... are just a few of the threats
that kept us up at night - and will keep us busy in 2016."" Imagine putting
life-saving e-cigarettes in the same sentence with killers like Ebola, HIV, and
OxyContin overdoses!



 Now, months later, two new high profile entries join the disinformation
sweepstakes: The National Institutes on Drug Abuse and the Chicago Department of
Health.



 NIDA is part of the National Institutes of Health. Its self-stated mission is
""bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction."" In that
case, its fact sheet on e-cigarettes doesn't meet its own standard. For example,
consider the NIDA response to the question, ""Are e-cigarettes safer than
conventional cigarettes?""



 Answer: Unfortunately, this question is difficult to answer because
insufficient information is available on these new products.



 ... These products have not been thoroughly evaluated in scientific studies.
This may change in the near future, but for now, very little data exists on the
safety of e-cigarettes, and consumers have no way of knowing whether there are
any therapeutic benefits or how the health effects compare to conventional
cigarettes.



 This is absurd. There is ample data showing the unequivocal relative safety of
e-cigarettes. Indeed, longitudinal research is needed, but the agency's warped
statement is useless to those considering alternatives to smoking. Worse, it may
well keep them smoking. What's more, NIDA's position is at odds with its avid
promotion of opiate harm reduction in the form of needle exchange and opiate
substitution drugs - that is, delivering opiates in a safer manner than heroin
and street pills. If NIDA is enthusiastic about advancing safer means of opiate
drug use as a means of improving public health, why is it unwilling to do the
same for nicotine?



 This brings us to Chicago where Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago Department of
Public Health Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita just launched ""'Vaping,' a new
public education and social media campaign. It is dedicated to informing youth
and families of the truth about the dangers of e-cigarettes.'"" The anti-vaping ""
Vaping"" effort trafficks in alarmist claims, warning of ""the highly addictive
nature of nicotine"" and ""the toxic chemicals and poisons found in e-liquids."" Of
the great advantages to smokers - no exposure to carcinogenic tar and carbon
monoxide, or improved respiratory health - there is no mention.



 But 2015 had some official bright spots, too. The best one came from across the
Atlantic. The CDC's British counterpart, Public Health England (PHE), an
executive agency of the UK Department of Health, became the first national
government agency to endorse e-cigarettes as safer options for smokers. In its
report, E-Cigarettes: An Evidence Update, PHE estimated that vaping was 95
percent safer than smoking, based on aerosol emissions, and strongly rejected
several common false claims about vaping, in particular that it is a pathway to
smoking among youth.

  Back in the U.S., the issue received balanced coverage from New York Times
columnist Joe Nocera, who devoted several columns to the virtues of vaping, and
New York Times reporter Sabrina Tavernise. David Amsden wrote a masterful
synthesis, E-cigs Inconvenient Truth: It's Much Safer to Vape, in Rolling Stone
this month.



 And bravo to a handful of politicians who weighed in on the public health
virtues of vaping, among them Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller who released a
statement this month in support of vaping: ""There has been an effort to say that
combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes are equally harmful, that their
companies are equally evil, and that they should be strongly regulated the same
way. This view is incorrect."" Also, Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) fought
against, though lost, the 2007 grandfather date for pre-market approval of
vaping products by the FDA.



 What of the FDA? Within the next few months, the agency will make crucial
decisions that will attest to the agency's professed awareness that smokeless
products reside on the very low end of the ""continuum of risk"" of tobacco
products.



 Early in 2016 should be a decision on Swedish Match snus. Will the FDA declare
snus a ""modified risk"" tobacco product and allow the company to remove or change
some of the four health warning labels on snus packaging, including a mouth
cancer warning? It should; data on the relative safety of snus compared to
combustible tobacco products are compelling.



 Then come the ""deeming"" regulations regarding vaping products. If the FDA
pursues an aggressive premarket approval regime for all vaping products, the
cost of smoking-to-switching trials and administrative requirements will be
burdensome enough to drive the overwhelming majority of e-cigarette products out
of the market.



 As I surveyed this tally of the bad, the good, and the yet-to-be decided, I
found myself veering toward pessimism. The detractors of vaping seem to have the
margin. But then I turned for solace to Clive Bates, the estimable brains (and
charm) behind the superlative Counterfactual.com blog, among the best sites for
public health literacy on the web.



 Clive found the bright spot: ""the free play of consumers, businesses and
innovators in a market so far largely untroubled by clumsy and wildly excessive
regulation, and increasingly by-passing the self-righteous cynics in public
health.""



 Indeed, vaping is up, smoking is down, and good businesses are making money by
doing the right thing.



 Consider Canada. Health Canada, the Canadian national public health service,
opted to treat vaping products as medicinal. This meant that they could not be
sold without nearly-impossible to obtain approval. The agency went so far as to
warn smokers against e-cigarettes, and abstinence-only anti-tobacco groups
attacked the products. ""But the market essentially ignored them,"" according to
David Sweanor of The Centre on Health Law, Policy & Ethics at the University of
Ottawa. ""Vape shops started opening all over the country and [#x200e]smokers in
large numbers switched to vaping.""

  Of necessity, vaping - and more broadly, tobacco harm reduction - has become a
bottom-up movement. The place to find energy and optimism is in the 8000 CASAA
testimonials (""how vaping saved my life"" and others) and similar
consciousness-raising around the world. The swell of social media is strong and
ungovernable. The weight of hypocrisy surrounding selective endorsement of harm
reduction (it's okay for heroin but not for nicotine) is great. And the data
concerning relative safety of vaping become more compelling every day. Together,
these forces, I am optimistic, will ultimately prevail.

Council split on city taking on vaping issue

BYLINE: Natascia Lypny, The Leader-Post

SECTION: CITY &; REGION; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 521 words","


After receiving a non-committal response from the health minister Wednesday,
some Regina councillors think it might be time the city examine bylaws on vaping
and smoking.

Delegates of the Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA) convention
earlier this week voted narrowly in favour of a resolution to push the
provincial Ministry of Health to add vaping to its tobacco legislation, banning
it in the same places as smoking.

Health Minister Dustin Duncan told convention delegates Wednesday he was
hesitant to add vaping to the legislation, citing a lack of information on its
health effects and its use by some as a smoking cessation tool.

Coun. Mike O'Donnell was ""disappointed"" by the minister's response.

""The province has responsibility for health care, and I was hoping that this
would be an issue that they would tackle,"" he said.

He's interested in assessing this issue at the local level, beginning with
looking at widening the scope of Regina's smoking ban. Saskatoon, Warman and
Martensville have done that, adding vaping as well, but O'Donnell said there's
still a lot more to learn about ecigarettes.

Coun. Barbara Young is in the same boat, hesitant to tackle vaping at the
municipal level.

""I think we have to deal with smoking in outdoor areas first,"" she said.

""I think that since we waited for the province to do something and they're not
going to do something from what I've heard, then I think we need to deal with it
as a city.""

Coun. Bob Hawkins is on board, too. That said, he is ""anxious that the
government recognize the importance of this matter both as a health issue and as
an issue protecting employees who work in public environments.""

The councillors agreed that consulting with residents is essential before making
any moves.

Addressing the matter at the municipal level is not a position held by all of
council, including Mayor Michael Fougere. He sees lobbying the government as his
main priority, saying ""those doors are not shut yet"" and that he will continue
talks with the minister and premier.

""I would suggest that (Duncan) can quite easily set the standard, set the
baseline for how we treat smoking and vaping in public areas in municipalities
across the province,"" Fougere said.

""I think it's a health issue and health issues should remain with the province,
not downloaded to cities.""

Councillors Shawn Fraser and Wade Murray were also hesitant.

""I think there's more public debate needed about the vaping issue,"" said Fraser.

Jennifer Miller, vice-president of health promotion with the Lung Association of
Saskatchewan, is in favour of municipalities tackling this issue themselves.

""Just because SUMA has passed this doesn't mean that we want municipalities to
sit back and wait for province to do it,"" she said, adding that they should
continue to advocate with the province simultaneously.

""It would certainly be a lot easier, it would certainly save municipalities a
lot of time and energy and effort, if the provincial government would just do it
and blanket it for the province.""

E-cigarette ads may fuel urge to smoke

LENGTH: 448 words","

DATELINE: India


India, March 13 -- Television advertisements for e-cigarettes may be enticing
current and even former tobacco smokers to reach for another cigarette, a new
study has found. Researchers Erin K Maloney and Joseph N Cappella from the
University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication studied more
than 800 daily, intermittent, and former smokers who watched e-cigarette
advertising, and who then took a survey to determine smoking urges, intentions,
and behaviours. Using a standard test to measure the urge to smoke a cigarette,
people who smoke tobacco cigarettes daily and who watched e-cigarette
advertisements with someone inhaling or holding an e-cigarette (vaping) showed a
greater urge to smoke than regular smokers who did not see the vaping. Former
smokers who watched e-cigarette advertisements with vaping had less confidence
that they could refrain from smoking tobacco cigarettes than former smokers
seeing e-cigarette ads without vaping.

""We know that exposure to smoking cues such as visual depictions of cigarettes,
ashtrays, matches, lighters, and smoke heightens smokers' urge to smoke a
cigarette, and decreases former smokers' confidence in their ability to refrain
from smoking a cigarette,"" said Maloney. ""Because many e-cigarette brands that
have a budget to advertise on television are visually similar to tobacco
cigarettes, we wanted to see if similar effects can be attributed to e-cigarette
advertising,"" Maloney said. Maloney and Cappella pulled together more than a
dozen e-cigarette advertisements via searches of Google, YouTube, and
e-cigarette web sites. They set up three conditions for the participants -
watching the advertisements, watching the advertisements with only the audio
(the visuals were replaced by scrolling text of the advertisement), or simply
answering a series of unrelated media use questions that took approximately the
same amount of time it would take to view the advertisements. Participants were
""daily,"" ""intermittent,"" or ""former"" smokers. The researchers observed a trend
that more daily smokers who viewed ads with vaping smoked a tobacco cigarette
during the experiment than daily smokers who viewed ads without vaping and daily
smokers who did not view ads. Over 35 per cent of the daily smokers in the
condition that showed vaping reported having a tobacco cigarette during the
study versus 22 per cent of daily smokers who saw ads without vaping, and about
23 per cent of daily smokers who did not see any advertising.

Alternative to smoking on offer at shop

SECTION: NEWS:OTHER; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 280  words","


A FORMER camera shop in Exeter's Guildhall Shopping Centre is set to re-open for
vapers - those seeking an alternative to smoking .

The Devon Camera Centre closed its doors for the final time after more than 50
years in business, last month.

Now a sign has gone up on the door of the empty shop proclaiming that a Flavour
Vapour shop will open there on the Easter Bank Holiday weekend.

Flavour Vapour was founded by a small group of vaping enthusiasts in 2012 to
help those wanting to make the switch from smoking to vaping.

The company has grown and now supports thousands of people across the UK and in
Europe in their efforts to make vaping an alternative to smoking.

Its head office is in Plymouth and it has shops around the country.

Vaping is intended for current adult smokers who wish to continue enjoying their
nicotine habit at a reduced risk.

Vaping utilises a propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin based liquid, mixed
with small amounts of nicotine and food grade flavouring that then get
vapourised in a small, battery-powered atomizer, simulating the experience of
smoking.

The vapour created is inhaled and exhaled much like cigarette smoke.

The Guildhall Shopping Centre, is undergoing a  £12m revamp to create a
""best-in-class"" dining quarter.

Owners Aviva Investors recently said it had been inundated with inquiries from
national and regional operators keen to be a part of Exeter's growing eating-out
scene.

The owners of Artigiano are in advanced talks over plans to create a flagship
venue in the former Poundland building in Market Square.

Devon Camera Ltd closed its Exmouth store just after Christmas. The independent
retailer employed five staff at its Exeter branch.

Vaping business group welcomes new rules

SECTION: IRELAND

LENGTH: 611 words","


The latest code drawn up by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland
stipulates that e-cigarette advertising should not promote tobacco use or
glamorise tobacco use.

Vape Business Ireland found that the code struck the right balance between
protecting minors while ensuring adults had access to information about vaping
products.

Last month, Public Health England, an agency of Britain s department of health,
backed the use of e-cigarettes because they were 95% safer than smoking tobacco.

It is our hope that our department of health will take a similar balanced
approach when legislating for vaping products later this year,  Vape Business
Ireland stated.

The alliance said they wanted effective, evidence-based, and balanced regulation
by the Government of vaping products.

The manufacture, supply, distribution, and sale of vaping products must be
regulated in a responsible manner while upholding the principles of consumer
choice for adults, particularly for adult smokers who wish to find an
alternative to tobacco products.

The code, which comes into force in March, includes rules on gambling
advertisements: They should not target children or imply gambling is a
substitute for work or that it can be an escape from personal problems.

There are new rules on food advertising that brings the code into line with the
EU regulation on nutrition and health that is mandatory and seeks to protect
consumers from misleading or false claims. Restrictions on children s
advertising has been extended. Food companies cannot advertise promotional
offers to preschool and primary school children, while promotional offers aimed
at older children should not encourage excess consumption.

Advertisements for beauty products should not show non-users of a cosmetic
product in a negative light while advertisements for medicines should not claim
the effects are guaranteed.

The ASAI said the rules on health and beauty advertising were designed to ensure
medicines, medical devices, treatments, health-related products, and beauty
products received the necessary high level of scrutiny.

Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Alex White, commended
the ASAI for seeking to champion the interests of the community in an ever more
interconnected and fast-paced age.

ASAI chairman Sean O Meara said the authority undertook the most transparent
consultative process in their history before producing the new seventh edition
of its code.  To ensure that the code will remain at all times credible and
relevant, there will be regular inspection and appraisal of the code with an
ongoing process of additions, amendments and strengthening, as required,  he
said.

Last year the ASAI, which is funded by the advertising industry, received 1,384
complaints from the public and 92 were upheld, with advertisers told to withdraw
or alter advertisements found to be in breach of the code. Almost two thirds
(64%) of the complaints made were on the basis that an advertisement was
misleading, while almost a quarter (24%) were because an advertisement was
offensive.

Facial injuries

A man was reportedly left unable to eat solid foods after an e-cigarette
exploded in his face   leaving a gaping hole in his mouth.

James Lauria, 23, from Cobb County, Georgia, was airlifted to hospital with

first-degree burns after the smoking device unexpectedly exploded.

Even after spending six weeks in intensive care, James is still unable to eat
solid foods and speaks with a lisp after the device blew a huge hole in his
mouth.

James also suffered burns to his hands and cornea, as well as a fractured neck
and finger during the July 29 incident, which is currently being investigated.

Malacca to ban vaping

BYLINE: Kelly Koh

SECTION: Pg. 6

LENGTH: 328 words","


MALACCA: VAPE traders' hopes of a reprieve against a ban on vaping have gone up
in smoke when the state decided to prohibit the practice here.

Chief Minister Datuk Seri Idris Haron, in announcing the ban, said the state
government would enforce the National Fatwa Council's edict forbidding vaping.

""We have received reports from the National Fatwa Committee regarding the edict
issued by the National Fatwa Council and the Malacca Islamic Religious Council
has accepted the decision.

""Malacca has decided to ban vaping, and will prohibit the sale and use of vape
in the state,"" he said during a visit to SK Sungai Udang here yesterday.

Idris had previously announced that the state would follow the Federal
Government's decision on vaping.

He said the deadline for the ban would be determined after the state had
finalised the number of vape traders in the state.

""I will discuss the matter in the state executive council meeting tomorrow and I
have directed the State Housing, Local Government and Environment Committee to
furnish me with details on the number of vape traders affected.

""Then only will we fix the enforcement date.""

On Dec 21, the National Fatwa Council declared that e-cigarettes and vapes were
haram (forbidden).

Its chairman, Professor Emeritus Tan Sri Dr Abdul Shukor Husin, said the
decision to ban vape was reached after taking into consideration all aspects,
including the syariah, medical and scientific views, as well as from the point
of wastage and unhealthy culture among youth.

Idris had earlier allowed vaping in the state as a study showed that the sales
and use of such products were not widespread in Malacca city.

This led to the Malacca Historical City Council approving business licences of
some 20 vape traders on Dec 19.

On the fate of vape traders in the state, Idris said the state government would
continue to provide them with other business opportunities.

Other states that have banned vaping included Johor, Kelantan and Terengganu.

Cancer Society here wants research on safety of vaping

BYLINE: John Brennan

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 469 words","


IT is too soon to describe e-cigarettes as a reputable product for combating
smoking, the Irish Cancer Society has said.

Experts in the UK are seeking to have the vaping devices made available on
prescription for people who want to give up tobacco.

New research released by Public Health England (PHE) states: ""E-cigarettes have
the potential to make a significant contribution to the endgame for tobacco.""
They say that e-cigarettes are 20 times less dangerous than tobacco.

However, the cancer society here says that further studies into the long-term
affects of vaping are needed before it could endorse the products.

Eoin Bradley, policy officer with the Irish Cancer Society (ICS), told the Irish
Independent that e-cigarettes are ""an area (which) is moving very fast. The
Irish Cancer Society will be reviewing any position on the basis of new
evidence.""

The ICS still points people who want to quit to traditional methods, such as
patches, gum and counselling, rather than vaping.

The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has received a number of inquiries about
the possibility of e-cigarettes being offered for sale or supply in pharmacies.

However, chemists are unable to stock e-cigarettes as they are not yet regulated
in Ireland.

The HSE has outlined that an EU Directive which has considered the role of
e-cigarettes has recommended that they be regulated as a nicotine-delivery
device.

New legislation is expected to be introduced next year that will apply similar
rules to e-cigarettes as those already in place for tobacco products.

E-cigarettes are currently banned in a number of countries around the world,
with Hong Kong, Brazil, the UAE and Panama having taken a hardline stance on
vaping.

In Ireland, they are banned in many work places, on Dublin Bus, trains,
hospitals and in some shopping centres.

Vape Business Ireland, which is a business alliance encouraging debate about
vaping products in Ireland, has welcomed statements from Public Health England
that e-cigarettes ""carry just a fraction of the harm"" of tobacco.

A spokesperson said: ""This evidence (from) Public Health England, which states
that e-cigarettes are 95pc less harmful to health than normal cigarettes, is
welcome.""

The UK research has shown that a problem with e-cigarettes is that many people
have perceived 'vaping' as more harmful than cigarettes. Which, according to the
PHE report, is not the case.

Vape Business Ireland is hoping that the Department of Health will take these
suggestions on board before enacting the new legislation next year.

It said: ""The Irish Department of Health is currently working towards regulating
vaping products in Ireland and we would hope that this timely contribution by
the a UK Health Department agency will assist our Department of Health in
bringing forward balanced and evidenced-based regulation.""

EDITORIAL: E-cigs bring benefits in smoking reduction

BYLINE: Grand Forks Herald

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 427 words","


March 15--Vaping looks like smoking.

And many regulators, including the FDA, want to treat vaping like smoking.

But vaping isn't smoking. Nor is vaping -- inhaling the nicotine-laced vapors of
e-cigarettes -- akin to tobacco use; simply put, e-cigs don't contain any
tobacco.

Instead, vaping is best thought of as a method of quitting smoking. As such, it
can be a public-health tool. Because while e-cigarettes are not ""safe,"" meaning
zero risk, they're proving to be both dramatically safer than regular cigarettes
and effective at helping people cut back on or quit smoking.

The public-health benefits of this latter achievement are huge. Regulators
should keep those benefits in mind -- which means they should avoid heavy-handed
rules that target vaping simply because the activity looks like smoking.

The strongest proponent of this view is Micheal Siegel, a professor at the
Boston University School of Public Health. Siegel has impeccable credentials as
an antismoking crusader. He has conducted tobacco research for 25 years and been
a strong supporter of strict smoking and secondhand-smoke policies.

So, ""when electronic cigarettes came to the U.S. about 2007, I was skeptical,""
Siegel wrote in January in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

""My assumption was they were a ploy by the tobacco industry to hook more people
into smoking under the guise of being a safer product. ... But as I talked to
many e-cigarette users, known as 'vapers,' conducted research (Journal of Public
Health Policy, 2011) and reviewed a growing body of scientific evidence, I
became convinced that e-cigarettes have dramatic potential for reducing disease
and death caused by smoking.""

That attitude has strengthened since then, as the evidence has grown that
e-cigarettes offer significant public-health benefits (through smoking
reduction) at comparatively low risk.

Importantly, Siegel is not calling for the FDA to abandon its regulatory role.
Just the opposite: The agency ""should set uniform safety standards for
e-cigarettes and 'vaping' products,"" he wrote.

""These standards should include childproof packaging, battery safety,
quality-control standards for nicotine labeling and the production of e-liquids""
and the like.

But heavily regulating e-cigarettes as tobacco products is overkill. Such rules
mean fewer smokers would quit smoking -- and that would be a public-health loss.

Editorial missed facts on vaping

Editorial missed facts on vaping

Your Opinion on Aug. 29 29, should have been called ""Far from Facts"" rather than
""Far from harmless.""

The article provided absolutely no hard evidence of any danger from the use of
e-cigarettes. Quite the contrary, this article spread what is known as ""Fear,
Uncertainty and Doubt"" or FUD for short. FUD was a tactic IBM used in the 60s
and 70s to get company executives to buy their products instead of a
competitor's without actually lying.

Comparing smoking tobacco to vaping is like comparing apples to oranges or more
accurately a bonfire to a vaporizer. While it is important to keep nicotine out
of the hands of children, you neglected to mention that the e-liquid comes in
varying amounts of nicotine, including zero.

In my opinion, the reason that the government and agencies funded by the
government are spreading FUD about vaping, is that they have nothing in place to
tax it.

Let's face it, if people are allowed to vape in public, more smokers will be
enticed to switch over. If that happens, tobacco use will drop and one of the
governments bigger tax cash cows will begin to disappear.

How sad it is that the media helps them accomplish their goal without having any
hard evidence to support their innuendos. Here are some facts;

1. Three people in my household, myself included, have given up tobacco use for
vaping. A fourth is working on it.

2. I use e-liquid with 0 percent nicotine. That's none, nada.

3. I feel better. My lungs are clear and I'm not coughing any more.

4. My primary care doctor, cardiologist, neurologist, and vascular surgeon
raised no concern with me vaping rather than smoking.

Perhaps it would be more advantageous for you not to jump on a bandwagon without
having concrete proof.

New Vaping business open

LENGTH: 402  words","


YOU may have heard about e-cigarettes and wondered what it's all about?

If you are a smoker and have never tried e-cigarettes, or vaping, or if you are
a vaper and need clearomizers, e-liquid and coils then pop into the Vaping
Agency at 2 Market Strand, in Falmouth, near the Prince of Wales Pier, and see
what it's all about.

The Vaping Agency is owned by Kevin Claydon, who opened the shop on July 4.
It's his first business venture after working in retail for many years.

He started working in an e-cigarette shop in 2013 and decided to try his hand in
a growing industry.  Since July sales and customer numbers have been growing
every week mainly by word of mouth.

Kevin offers a try-before-you-buy service where customers can try e-liquids and
any of the kit.  The Vaping Agency has over 101 e-liquid flavours, an extensive
range of batteries and clearomizers.

A rechargeable battery provides the power which will last  all day.

You get two clearomizers and these hold the e-liquid.

They take the power from the battery and vaporise the e-liquid to create the
'vape' similar to the smoke from a cigarette.

You can get any flavour from tobacco, fruits such as blueberry which is very
popular, bubblegum, whisky, menthol, coffee, chocolate and cinnamon.

The e-liquid comes in various strengths of nicotine.

""Getting the right strength is crucial,"" says Kevin, ""as an e-cigarette must
replicate the amount of nicotine that you get of your traditional cigarette.""

People can tailor their liquid's strength.

There is also a range of zeros with no nicotine whatsoever.

Kevin will advise you on the correct strength.

The Vaping Agency is committed to making the switch to electronic cigarettes a
smooth transition.

The bottles come in 10ml size which is the equivalent of 100 cigarettes and sell
for £3.99 each or three for £10. Another saving is to take advantage of the
Stoptober promotion. Pop into the Vaping Agency and get a starter pack for
£17.99 in October, a saving of £2.  With it you get a free liquid and the chance
to try one of the 101 flavours on offer.

And to top it all Kevin offers a no-nonsense guarantee: if you buy a starter kit
and after a month find it is not for you then you can get your money back, no
questions asked. So pop in and see what's on offer and don't forget you can try
before you buy.

Best way to quit raises questions

HIGHLIGHT: Study looks at reducing the dangers of smoking


A UK study has generated headlines proclaiming electronic cigarettes as an
established new way to reduce the harms of smoking or quit altogether.

But such claims are not only premature, they may be all smoke and mirrors.

Two of the biggest promises feeding the fervour for electronic cigarettes
(e-cigs) are that they knock the socks off other ways of quitting smoking and
that they're a terrific way of reducing harm because ""vaping"", as it's known,
can reduce the number of cigarettes regular smokers consume.

But do electronic cigarettes actually help smokers quit?

Globally, there are probably hundreds of thousands of people who quit smoking by
vaping. Many argue it's their experience that counts, but the plural of anecdote
isn't evidence.

Most studies on quitting cigarettes using e-cigs are almost worthless for
smokers at large because they're drawn from non-representative populations, such
as vaping chatrooms.

Data from such research tend to show sometimes stratospheric success levels
(some reported 81% success rates for quitting) but basing knowledge on the
experiences of those for whom vaping is a major part of life is like polling
active members of a wine appreciation society to understand community-wide
drinking patterns.

The recent study is by far the most important on how smokers use e-cigarettes.

It examined 5863 smokers who'd made an attempt to quit in the past year and
found 93 out of the 464 people who used e-cigarettes were successful (20%),
while 194 out of the 1922 people using nicotine replacement therapy made it
(10.1%).

Of the 3477 people trying to quit unassisted, 535 did so (15.4%).

But looked at another way, the findings of this large study were that 80% of
smokers trying to quit by vaping were still smoking, compared with 84.6% of
those tried to quit on their own.

That hardly looks like a champagne-popping difference deserving the accolades
abounding in narratives about vaping.

And, of course, many of the quitters relapse weeks or months after completing
the questionnaire, so the figures become less flattering over time.

We know that, because of relapse, those quitting unassisted or with nicotine
replacement therapy bought over the counter have about 4% continuous abstinence
at 12 months.

We don't have any data yet on relapses by e-cigarette users, but if we assume
they do so at the same rate then we might expect a tiny fraction over this 4%,
regardless of method used, to be still not smoking a year later.

The most common outcomes of smokers vaping are that they smoke and vape at the
same time (dual use rather than vaping instead of smoking) and they reduce the
number of cigarettes smoked each day.

So it sounds entirely reasonable to assume that people who cut down the number
of cigarettes they smoke each day reverse that risk and reduce harm.

What we don't know is how many smokers now using both would have quit altogether
in the absence of electronic cigarettes.

It's highly likely many vapers who continue to smoke do so because they've
convinced themselves that cutting down on cigarettes has significantly reduced
their risk.

Meanwhile, headlines about the study should probably have said there were nearly
six times as many smokers who quit without any assistance than vapers who did.

The radical news that deserves shouting from the rooftops is that going cold
turkey has always been the method used by more successful quitters than any
other method.

Smokers, non-smokers turn to vaping in Morris as industry grows

BYLINE: Heidi Litchfield, Morris Daily Herald, Ill.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1060 words","


Oct. 18--MORRIS -- Alex Grissom of Marseilles wants no part of smoking and
struggles to understand why anyone would purposely inhale the tar and chemicals
found in cigarettes.

As he explains his position on cigarette smoking, a large plume of what looks
like white smoke emits from his mouth. But it's actually vapor escaping from his
lips. He is one of many who uses an atomizer to vape.

""I never started smoking cigarettes because I didn't want the added chemicals
and tar,"" he said. ""I have no desire to ever smoke a cigarette.""

To vape, a user will pull from a mouthpiece at the top of an electronic
cigarette or atomizer, which vaporizes liquid that can contain nicotine.
E-cigarettes are thought not have the carcinogenic impact of smoking tobacco.

Grissom said knowing what is in vaping liquid makes him comfortable inhaling it.
Vaping uses a liquid made up typically of four ingredients: propylene glycol or
vegetable glycerin, food grade flavoring, liquid nicotine and water that gets
vaporized in a battery-powered atomizer.

The vape scene has seen a steady increase since the introduction of
e-cigarettes, and been more prominent locally since September when two vapor
stores opened in Morris -- 24 Vapor Vape Shop and Starved Rock Vapor.

The opening of vapor stores gives those interested in modified atomizers a place
to go and talk shop, try new flavors and learn about what is available, instead
of just picking up a pack at a gas station.

Morris Mayor Richard Kopczick said the two stores are offering a product and
service that was previously available locally, but these two shops' sole focus
is on the atomizers and the e-liquid.

""I think as more people become aware of what vaping is and how it can be used,
we'll see even more vapers in this area,"" said Tanner Barra, an employee at
Starved Rock Vapor in Morris.

Barra said while some people still use the initial disposable e-cigarette, many
more are using newer devices such as rebuildable dripping atomizers, rebuildable
tank atomizers and mechanical mods so they can better control what goes into
their bodies.

""A majority of the e-cigarettes that came out initially were made by cigarette
companies, and you didn't know what was in there or how much nicotine you were
getting with each drag,"" Barra said. ""With the devices we sell, and are most
common today, you are able to adjust what you get both in flavor and in
nicotine.""

A tool to stop smoking

Barra was a two-pack-a-day smoker when he found himself without a job and
needing to curb his expensive habit.

""I started using the basic e-cigarette just to save money,"" he said.

As the industry changed and new devices came out, and once Barra had a job, he
started trying the new devices, which gave him more control over the amount of
nicotine he was getting.

The nicotine levels can vary from 0 milligrams to 24 milligrams, depending on
the user's choice of e-liquid or juice, as it is referred to by the vaping
community.

Today Barra smokes primarily liquids that have three milligrams of nicotine, far
less than what he was getting from two packs a day.

""There is 36 milligrams of nicotine, plus paper and chemicals, in a cigarette,""
he said. ""Depending on how much you vape a day you can get three times less
nicotine than a normal full cigarette.""

He has been vaping for a year now and no longer smokes cigarettes, as he much
prefers the fruity flavors offered in vaping to the taste of a regular
cigarette.

""My advice to anyone trying to use vapes to stop smoking is to get through the
first four days. When you have the urge to smoke, vape instead,"" he said. ""After
the fourth day if you pick up a cigarette you will only take one or two drags
before throwing it out. It tastes horrible.""

Grissom said when he started vaping, he had no idea it would give him the added
benefit of weight loss -- which he also credits to the various available
flavors.

""I've lost 30 pounds since I started vaping,"" he said. ""I didn't expect that,
but with the sweet flavors, I find my cravings for sweets are not there.""

Searching for juice online finds all kinds of sweet-treat inspired flavors, such
as key lime pie and holiday pumpkin spice cake from Baked Vapes, and banana
creme pie and rocky road from Palm Beach Vapors.

Starved Rock Vapors even offers cereal-inspired flavors that mimic Fruit Loops
and Apple Jacks.

Regulation

But regulators and some taxing bodies are taking a look at the rapidly growing
use of electronic cigarettes and considering the health impact of vaping.

In August 2014, the Illinois General Assembly amended the Illinois Poison
Prevention Packaging Act to mandate all electronic cigarette cartridges and
liquids sold and marketed be in special packaging.

On Jan. 1, Illinois also started enforcing a law that all e-cigarettes and vapor
products must be kept behind store counters in an age-restricted area or in a
sealed display case. In 2013 Illinois passed a law restricting sales to those
over 18.

Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan three weeks ago joined attorneys general
from 33 states calling for tighter federal regulations over electronic
cigarettes to protect children and young adults from nicotine addiction.

Madigan's office, in a news release, urged action by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, calling for child-resistant packaging and warning labels
""similar to the labels on other tobacco products."" Such regulations already
exist in Illinois.

""Nicotine is harmful no matter how it is consumed,"" Madigan said in a statement,
""and e-cigarettes should come with warnings about its dangers.""

But vaping and nicotine aren't always synonymous. Grissom pointed out most of
the e-liquid he uses contains none. As someone who never smoked, he isn't
looking for liquid flavors that contain nicotine.

Kopczick said he understands some people are leery of what they perceive to be a
new thing, but it's not the city's job to police morality.

The city hasn't received any more business license applications for vape shops,
according to Kopczick.

He said the city will not put a limit on the number that can open in Morris,
just like it doesn't put a limit on the number of stores that can sell
cigarettes.

Airport and Aviva join the ban on vaping

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 401 words","


TWO more Irish companies have banned vaping. Dublin airport and the Aviva
stadium have joined Dublin Bus, Bus Eireann and Irish Rail in outlawing
electronic cigarettes, writes Siobhán Maguire.

The Aviva said: ""Since the stadium opened in 2010 it has had a no smoking
policy. This covers all forms of smoking. There are designated smoking areas
outside.""

Siobhán O'Donnell, a communications manager with Dublin Airport Authority, said:
""Electronic cigarettes are not regulated so they fall under the current policy
of no cigarette smoking in the terminals at Dublin airport. We will keep this
position under review.""

Earlier this month Irish Rail announced its policy is to forbid smoking of
electronic cigarettes on trains and enclosed platforms.

Pro-smoking groups have reacted angrily to the latest restrictions. John Mallon
of Forest Eireann said attitudes to vaping, like smoking, were being driven by a
phobia towards tobacco and anything resembling it.

""I wrote to Irish Rail after their ban and asked them if these same people
complaining about inhaling somebody else's vapour had an issue with the sweaty
man or woman, or mother with a screaming child?"" Mallon said. ""I made the point
that trains give out carcinogenic fumes, and did people complain about that? I
don't know where this vaping ban is going, but there has to be tolerance for the
other person. I think all of this is a disgrace.""

While there is no legislation on vaping in Ireland, James Reilly, the health
minister, has said he plans to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s and is
reviewing the pros and cons of vaping devices.

The European parliament has indicated that e-cigarettes will be regulated across
the EU in the near future. For now, member states can decide whether the
products are to be classified as medicines or tobacco products. If the latter,
they must carry health warnings, be childproofed, and be subject to the same
restrictions on advertising as tobacco products. Sales of e-cigarettes in
Ireland grew by 478% last year, and the market is worth (EURO)7.3m.

Nielsen Total Scantrack for Ireland has estimated that overall tobacco sales
generated almost (EURO)1.2bn in 2013, down 1.2% year on year. Sales of
cigarettes fell by 4%, but sale of loose tobacco grew by 28%.

This week marks the 10th anniversary of the republic becoming the first country
to ban smoking in pubs, restaurants and workplaces.

Vaping not as bad as smoking!

LENGTH: 1286 words","

DATELINE: Bangladesh


Bangladesh, Feb. 15 -- Everyone has a different story. It was a day about
fifty-five years ago when for the first time I smoked a cigarette at the
backyard of a tea stall, near my school at Brahmanbaria, at the behest of one of
my naughty classmates. The brand was 'King Stork'. He gave me a stick to try. It
was horrible, but I didn't care because I was such a novice. I can only imagine
how dumb I looked. I coughed and felt choked as I inhaled and exhaled clouds of
smoke that brought on a bitter feeling of nausea. When now I see a teenager
smoking, all I can picture is my furtive day that set off my perilous voyage of
smoking.

I have ever since enjoyed smoking as it relieved my boredom and aided my
relaxation. Whenever I ran out of cigarettes I found it almost unbearable. It
was like a pill that relieved my stress. Old movies, where smoking was always
sublime, greatly inspired me to smoke. I had the dexterity to blow smoke rings
that would rise and glide elegantly, earning me attention and admiration from a
crowd. It was impossible to resist my temptation to light up a cigarette when I
was in a melancholy mood or, say, when my mind drifted away to cast a listless
glance at the meaninglessness of life as I would listen to the sombre tone of
Hemanta Mukherjee singing Keno Jamini Na Jete Jagale Na, Bela Holo Mori Lajey
(Why did you not awaken me before the night ended?).

But, as I look back on my life, I realise that by smoking I have committed a
slow-suicide, a gradual self-murder that, like homicide, should be punishable by
law. Not only had I been killing myself, I have directly or indirectly
encouraged during the last half a century a plethora of youngsters to tread my
suicidal pathway. According to religious beliefs, smoking is sinful. And perhaps
there should also be a law to punish a wilful smoker with the charge of an
attempted suicide. Any jury, comprised even of smokers only, should not pardon
my liberty of smoking on the grounds of a justifiable slow-suicide.

With the benefit of hindsight, I can sympathise with parents who wished their
children did not pick up the bad habit of smoking. I now understand why my
father thought I was ruining my life by smoking. As a token of my penitence,
however, I made several attempts to quit smoking, but my every single attempt
proved futile until, thanks to my nephew Tashfiq Islam, I discovered only two
months back a contraption that appears strange and a little complicated, a
vaping device that has helped me at long last to say goodbye to cigarettes. This
is an electronic device called vapouriser by which I vape. Determined to help me
quit smoking, my nephew smashed my two full packets of cigarettes that I tried
to hide in order to smoke a stick or two surreptitiously. He has thus succeeded
to turn me into a full-time vaper.

The vapouriser helps me inhale and exhale vapour extracted from tobacco-free
natural ingredients, reducing to a great extent the harmful effects of smoking.
The main ingredients of vaping are benign chemicals such as vegetable glycerin
and propylene glycol blended with a natural or synthetic flavour of your choice.
You may choose tobacco flavour if you don't want to forget your long smoking
habit. A different flavour like that of mango or strawberry or something else is
a good choice if you don't want to evoke the toxic memory associated with
cigarettes. You can add a minuscule amount of nicotine and enhance the
temperature of the vapour to enjoy almost a similar kick of smoking. Buy a
bottle of readymade e-juice from a vendor to refill the tank of the vapouriser
or make a huge savings by homemaking the same juice if you have a penchant for
chemistry.

To a long-time smoker, vaping may be a bogus substitute or an unpalatable
imitation of smoking, an unpleasant exercise akin to what in Bengali we
figuratively call Dhuder Shaad Ghooley Metano meaning ""to be satisfied with whey
in the absence of milk"". True. But Ghool (whey) is not as bad as we suspect. In
America, whey is marketed as a protein-rich dietary supplement and various
health claims are attributed to it.

Question is which habit is safer: vaping or smoking? The jury is still out as to
whether or not vaping is safe or healthy. However, most people would agree that
vaping is a much healthier and safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. If
you blow cigarette smoke out on a napkin it will turn yellow instantly. With
vapour the napkin will remain white. This gives an idea as to what smoking may
be doing to the inside of our lungs. Clearly the compounds found in vaped steam
are deemed less harmful than the cancer-causing agents found in traditional
cigarettes. But less harmful doesn't necessarily mean safe.

Anybody who has started vaping would say vaping is way better than smoking a
cigarette or a cigar or any other tobacco product and it helps a long-time
smoker quit cigarette smoking. According to a recent study, smokers are 60 per
cent more likely to quit with the help of an electronic smoking device.

One stick of cigarette contains well over 4,000 toxic chemicals including 43
known cancer-causing (carcinogenic) compounds and 400 other toxins. This
includes nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, as well as formaldehyde, ammonia,
hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, and DDT. On the other hand, in the juice of a
vapouriser or an e-cigarette there is no toxic chemicals except controllable
nicotine or even no nicotine at all. The other advantages in vapourising include
no flame, no burning of tobacco, no unpleasant smells, no dirty ashtrays, and
you can puff wherever or whenever you want, and you can satisfy, at least
partly, your craving for cigarette smoking. And it is less expensive.

Thousands of people around the world have already turned to electronic
cigarettes in hopes of avoiding the heart and cancer risks associated with
smoking conventional tobacco products. Now that cigarette industries are scared
of vaping industries, lobbyists of cigarette manufacturers are leaving no stone
unturned to prod scientists and researchers to sniff out demerits of vaping.
Studies have already been published suggesting that vaping may pose immune,
behavioural, and reproductive risks. But, such risks are already there even for
those who drink excessively unpurified water or heavily caffeinated beverages.
Such negative studies against vaping are not surprising at a time when cigarette
industries are facing their real enemy for the first time in their history.

Most of us who smoke know well that it is more a habit and brainwashing than an
addiction. We should ask ourselves why other habits, some of them enjoyable
ones, are easy to break, yet a habit that tastes awful, costs us a fortune and
kills us is so difficult to break? By answering the question you can find it
easy to stop smoking, if you are a smoker and if you try vaping.

In fact, one of the many conundrums about smoking is that when we are actually
smoking a cigarette, we look at it and wonder why we are doing it. It is only
when we have been deprived that the cigarette becomes precious. A smoker is
hooked to his cigarettes. So, when you and I believe we are hooked, we can never
be relaxed unless we do something that feels like smoking. What, then, is a
better idea than vaping, an activity that will not make you feel deprived of
inhaling and exhaling those dense clouds of smoke? With a little bit of practice
with your vapouriser, you may also show your talent in blowing those smoke rings
that would look like magic.

HIGHLIGHT: The Clark County ordinance restricting the use of electronic
cigarettes in public places and places of employment goes into effect Monday.



Electronic cigarette users will have to take their vapors outdoors after this
weekend.
The Clark County ordinance restricting the use of electronic cigarettes in
public places and places of employment goes into effect Monday. The ordinance,
approved by the county board of health on April 30, subjects e-cigarettes and
other vaping devices to the same restrictions as tobacco cigarettes under the
state's Smoking in Public Places law.


The one exception under the ordinance is stores that exclusively sell vaping
devices and supplies.
Specialty vape shops can allow customers to try the devices and sample liquid
nicotine flavors, but the stores must have independent ventilation systems that
prevent the vapors from making it into neighboring businesses.
Under the county ordinance, vaping devices cannot be used in public places and
places of employment, nor can they be used within 25 feet of doors, windows or
ventilation intakes.
Smoking and vaping are also prohibited in outdoor service areas, such as patio
seating areas and beer gardens, if employees work in or pass through the areas
while on duty, according to Clark County Public Health.
Businesses must post ""No smoking, no vaping"" signs at each entrance and other
prominent locations in the building. Clark County Public Health is offering
free signs for local businesses; call 360-397-8000 ext. 7378.
Ordinance enforcement
Compliance with the state Smoking in Public Places law and the Clark County
ordinance is the responsibility of the person in charge of an area open to the
public or a place of employment. Clark County Public Health will enforce the
laws for businesses. Local law enforcement will address individuals violating
the laws.
Employees, customers and other members of the public can confidentially report
violations to the health department online,
www.clark.wa.gov/public-health/concern.html
, or by calling 360-397-2550 and leaving a message with the business name,
address and time of the violation.
People who violate the laws by smoking, vaping or destroying a sign can receive
a civil fine of up to $100. Businesses violating the laws will receive an
initial warning and notice for correction. If the violation continues, the
business can be fined up to $100 per day.

Vaping lounge opens in downtown Orono

BYLINE: Nok-Noi Ricker BDN Staff

LENGTH: 501 words","


ORONO, Maine -- The popularity of vaping -- inhaling flavored and often
nicotine-laced vapor using electronic cigarettes -- appears to be growing in
Maine, with a vaping shop and lounge opening recently in downtown Orono and
another one planned for Mars Hill.


Everything Vapes opened on Oct. 24 at the corner of Main and Mill streets, and
store manager Jaimee Batchelder said the owners are planning another store.


""We're actually a chain store,"" Batchelder said recently in the shop's small
lounge between puffs of thick white vapor. ""We have two stores in Delaware and
one in Pennsylvania. Hopefully, by the end of next week, we'll have one open in
Mars Hill for Aroostook County customers.""


Everything Vapes carries a variety of e-cigarettes and e-liquids to fill them
that are made in house using just four ingredients. The electronic devices heat
the e-liquid, which is made of vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, flavoring
and, most of the time, nicotine, into a vapor that is inhaled.


""It's mostly all propylene glycol,"" Batchelder said.


The Food and Drug Administration lists propylene glycol as ""generally recognized
as safe,"" which means that it is acceptable for use in flavorings, drugs and
cosmetics and as a direct food additive, according to the Centers for Disease
Control.


Vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol, the base for all the e-liquid flavors,
are used in many common products. Vegetable glycerin, also known as glycerol, is
a naturally occurring chemical used in some medicines, according to the health
website WebMD.


Some communities, including Portland, have banned vaping in public places where
smoking is already prohibited.


""Vaping has come so far over the years. We now know what is in it and what comes
out,"" Batchelder said. ""People worry about second-hand vape, but it's not smoke.
It's vegetable glycerin. Nothing comes out except water vapor.""


Despite what Batchelder says, with e-cigarettes, now sometimes called vape pens,
only hitting the American market around 2006, health experts say more study is
needed. Most agree vaping is better than smoking cigarettes, which are filled
with numerous harmful chemicals and have been studied for decade.


The vaping store manager said that many users start out as smokers trying to
give up the habit. Typical pre-packaged e-cigarettes sold at convenience stores
cost around $10 apiece, and middle- and high-cost e-cigarettes range from $25 to
$400. Not knowing the ingredients in the pre-packaged ""big tobacco"" e-cigs is
one reason why vaping supply stores, where customers can choose from a selection
of liquids to refill their vape pens, are becoming more popular, Batchelder
said.


""We have set ups for everybody, everything for the person who quit smoking to
the hobbyist who wants the flavor,"" she said.


The Orono shop cuts down drive time for vapers in the area who had to travel to
at least Bangor before for supplies.


A display with at least 20 different flavors for taste testing, some without
nicotine, sits on the shop's counter.

To ban is to criminalise

SECTION: Comment; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 497 words","


BANNING e-cigarettes and vaping on the basis of ""whatever chemical elements that
you inhale, besides oxygen, may affect your lungs"" is lame when cigarette
smoking is legal. No doubt the sin tax for cigarettes has risen and some smokers
who are feeling the pinch have resolved to kick the habit. Others, however, are
adamantly going to continue because they are too far gone to retrace their
steps. Breathing nicotine-laced smoke as opposed to air has become addictive and
no matter what the scare, this habit is going to stay. Therefore, no alternative
will be entertained.

On the other hand, many are resorting to e-cigarettes as a means towards the
ultimate parting of ways with carcinogenic tobacco smoke. Given the argument
that it is safer than cigarettes, vaping with nicotine-containing fluids could
act as the first step towards ultimate weaning, as some former smokers have
claimed. To ban it merely to prevent habits from taking hold then is to deprive
smokers of one method of shedding a dangerous habit, and this after the deputy
director-general (public health) admitted that vaping and e-cigarettes are
distinct activities sharing the same device. All told, the danger of vaping, the
use of a fluid that is nicotine free, is based on assumption alone. There is no
evidence as to its long-term danger. In the immediate term, users claim that the
fluid can be made using baking supplies found in the kitchen, which they assume
to be safe. Either way, proof does not exist, but the main difference between
vaping and smoking is obvious from the terms used: vapour and smoke. The latter
is dangerous, although tobacco corporations find an ""authoritative"" voice or two
willing to de-link cigarettes from lung cancer and other fatal diseases.

In short, if the government is to ban e-cigarettes and vaping, a move not
totally unwelcomed, it must also have the commitment to ban smoking. To make
Malaysia a non-smoking haven, while it can easily be enjoyed elsewhere, though,
is to turn Malaysians into cigarette tourists. No longer will Jakarta, say, be a
golfing destination. Also, the addiction to cigarettes is real. Those deprived
of smoking could end up being unproductive in the workplace as they try to cope
with withdrawal symptoms. The government then is placed into a Catch-22
situation, damned if it does and damned if it doesn't ban cigarettes. And, that
scenario does not take into account the possibility of the habit going
underground.

The Health Ministry must be realistic. The banning of cigarettes is unachievable
given the massive economic contributions of the tobacco corporations: employment
and the sin tax. It is best then to treat smoking and vaping as the same cluster
of undesirable habit. Consequently, slapping a hefty tax reflecting the degree
of danger each habit poses to public health would be the benign approach.
Smokers are, after all, not criminals the way drug addicts are. And, unlike drug
addicts, smokers contribute to the economy.

Pennsylvania: E-Cigarette Advertising Makes One Crave ...Tobacco? Surprising
Findings by Penn Researchers

LENGTH: 683  words","

DATELINE: Harrisburg


Annenberg School for Communication, The State of Pennsylvania has issued the
following news release:

Television advertisements for e-cigarettes may be enticing current and even
former tobacco smokers to reach for another cigarette.

That is the finding by researchers Erin K. Maloney, Ph.D. and Joseph N.
Cappella, Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for
Communication, as reported in the journal Health Communication.

The researchers studied more than 800 daily, intermittent, and former smokers
who watched e-cigarette advertising, and who then took a survey to determine
smoking urges, intentions, and behaviors.

Using a standard test to measure the urge to smoke a cigarette, people who smoke
tobacco cigarettes daily and who watched e-cigarette advertisements with someone
inhaling or holding an e-cigarette (aka vaping) showed a greater urge to smoke
than regular smokers who did not see the vaping. Former smokers who watched
e-cigarette advertisements with vaping had less confidence that they could
refrain from smoking tobacco cigarettes than former smokers seeing e-cigarette
ads without vaping.
The findings are significant, considering that tobacco advertising on television
went up in smoke over four decades ago by way of a federal ban.  Moreover,
e-cigarette advertising is stoked by big tobacco companies. Estimates peg
e-cigarette ad spending at more than $1 billion this year. That number is
expected to grow at a 50 percent rate over the next four years.

""We know that exposure to smoking cues such as visual depictions of cigarettes,
ashtrays, matches, lighters, and smoke heightens smokers' urge to smoke a
cigarette, and decreases former smokers' confidence in their ability to refrain
from smoking a cigarette,"" said Dr. Maloney. ""Because many e-cigarette brands
that have a budget to advertise on television are visually similar to tobacco
cigarettes, we wanted to see if similar effects can be attributed to e-cigarette
advertising.""

Maloney and Cappella pulled together more than a dozen e-cigarette
advertisements via searches of Google, YouTube, and e-cigarette web sites. They
set up three conditions for the participants - watching the advertisements,
watching the advertisements with only the audio (the visuals were replaced by
scrolling text of the advertisement), or simply answering a series of unrelated
media use questions that took approximately the same amount of time it would
take to view the advertisements. Participants were ""daily,"" ""intermittent,"" or
""former"" smokers.

Maloney and Cappella observed a trend that more daily smokers who viewed ads
with vaping smoked a tobacco cigarette during the experiment than daily smokers
who viewed ads without vaping and daily smokers who did not view ads.  Over 35
percent of the daily smokers in the condition that showed vaping reported having
a tobacco cigarette during the study versus 22 percent of daily smokers who saw
ads without vaping, and about 23 percent of daily smokers who did not see any
advertising.

""Given the sophistication of cigarette marketing in the past and the exponential
increase in advertising dollars allotted to e-cigarette promotion in the past
year, it should be expected that advertisements for these products created by
big tobacco companies will maximize smoking cues in their advertisements, and if
not regulated, individuals will be exposed to much more e-cigarette advertising
on a daily basis,"" Maloney and Cappella wrote.

The editor of Health Communication, Teresa Thompson, Ph.D., University of
Dayton,  commented, ""These findings are especially relevant to ongoing health
and policy discussions, as they indicate that it is not just the health impact
of e-cigs and vaping themselves that must be considered.  The interrelationship
between tobacco smoking and media representations of the 'e' versions examined
in this study make clear that portrayal of actions that just look like smoking
has an effect on viewers who smoke or used to smoke.""

Saskatoon may restrict public vaping; Proposed bylaw would put electronic
cigarettes on par with regular smokes

BYLINE: Sean Trembath, Saskatoon Starphoenix

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 413 words","


Jim Wollf has heard the same story time and time again from customers at his
vape shop.

""They came in, they weren't sure, they bought a kit from us, then you see them a
week later and they say they haven't had one cigarette since the day they bought
it. It's a very positive thing,"" Wollf, one of the owners of Heavy Jam Vapour
Supply in Saskatoon, said.

The use of electronic cigarettes, or vaping, could become much more restricted
in the city if a proposed change to the local smoking bylaw is approved by city
council Monday. The change would make vaping identical to smoking in the eyes of
the law as of Jan. 1, meaning it would be prohibited in public buildings, bus
shelters, schools, businesses and other places cigarettes are currently not
allowed. Wollf said he understands the argument that vaping puts unnatural
chemicals into a person's body, but argued it should be looked at as a
harm-reduction strategy.

""Almost anybody you talk to, they'll say, 'I know this isn't a great thing to be
doing to myself, but if I wasn't doing this, I'd be out smoking a pack and a
half of cigarettes a day,' "" he said.

City Coun. Pat Lorje brought forth the proposed bylaw change.

When asked why she thinks vaping should be equated with regular cigarettes, her
answer was to the point.

""Why shouldn't it be?"" Lorje said. Council recently approved another change to
the bylaw banning smoking from any public area other than streets and sidewalks.
That change is also set to take effect Jan. 1, and vaping would be prohibited in
those areas as a result if council approves the new change Monday.

The report in Monday's council agenda asks for clarification on two points.
First, it points out there is no allowance made for specialty shops and says
such an article could be added. Lorje said she is still considering this
question.

Wollf said not being allowed to demo products would be a significant hit to his
business. Some of the vaping liquid is fairly expensive, he said, and it is also
important to demonstrate how to use one of the electronic cigarettes for a first
timer.

The second point of clarification sought in the report for council concerns
traditional aboriginal ceremonies. There is already a carveout in the provincial
smoking law allowing for tobacco use indoors in cultural and spiritual events.
The report says a similar article could be added to the city bylaw.

'Vaping' endangers teens;
Strong THC from marijuana can be easily hidden

BYLINE: Kim Ring, TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A,1,999

LENGTH: 869 words","


WEST BOYLSTON -- They may look like teenagers bent over a book in the library or
grabbing things from their locker or ducking into the restroom with a pen in
their mouth.

But in reality, the pen might be a device used to inhale vapors from the
strongest form of THC, the chemical in marijuana that creates the high feeling
people get when they use it.

""Oh, it's very disturbing,"" Worcester County Sheriff Lewis G. Evangelidis said.
""We're trying to stay ahead of the curve with this.""

The sheriff's programs have reached 120,000 students, but he now also wants
parents to know what to look for if they suspect their child might be dabbling
with drugs, and the new trend of ""vaping,"" as it's called, has him worried.

""A year ago, the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year was selfie,"" Sheriff
Evangelidis said. ""This year's word is vape, and most people don't know what it
means but I'm afraid a year from now a lot of people will know it.""

The word vape dates back to 1983 when a article in ""New Society"" described a
hypothetical device that could allow for the inhaling of vapors, the Oxford
Dictionary's website states. In 2009 the word began appearing in ""mainstream
sources,"" the dictionary's website explains.

Vaping comes from the growing popularity of electronic cigarettes, something
that in itself has health workers including Chief of Community Health in
Worcester, Karyn E. Clark, concerned because the nicotine delivery devices
aren't regulated and are widely available and target young people.

The packaging for e-cigarettes and nicotine products sometimes mimics the bright
colors and displays of candy, Mrs. Clark said. Young children are being
increasingly exposed to liquid nicotine, which doesn't come in child-proof
containers and there are other dangers, as well.

There is also an impression that the vapor cigarettes are safer than smoking
traditional tobacco products but the FDA hasn't given approval for the devices
and the long-term effects of vaping aren't yet known, she said.

These days vaping has also come to mean inhaling vapors of THC three times
stronger than those found in marijuana rolled into joints to be smoked. That
process involves something users call a g-cigarette and ""dabs,"" ""Oil,"" ""710"" or
""shatter;"" small, sticky pieces of concentrated THC or an oily substance; all
made using marijuana plants, butane, heat and parts easily found at hardware
stores.

""It's the most high you'll ever get from smoking weed,"" 24-year-old Zach said.
He smoked dabs the first time before a planned golf outing and arrived at the
course so stoned he had to go home. He slept for a while afterwards.

""It's like smoking the whole joint in one hit,"" he said.

Zach is clean now, part of the sheriff's Community Connections program, but he's
doubtful he would have stopped using if he hadn't gotten into trouble. He lost a
good career as a tradesman and is trying to find a new direction for his life.

And while he doesn't think vaping led him to higher level street drugs, he
developed a Percocet addiction after an injury and when he couldn't get the
""percs"" anymore, he turned to heroin. Despite his longtime fear of needles, he
eventually began shooting up.

Brittney is 21. Her hair and makeup are perfect and it would probably come as a
surprise to someone seeing her for the first time that when she wanted to be
cool in high school she started smoking pot. Then she vaped.

""I was good after two hits,"" she said. ""I wasn't really functionable. I wasn't
like trying to see my parents or anything.""

She said she wouldn't recommend driving a car as high as she was and she
suspects kids who are vaping in school are probably half asleep at their desks.

She believes that marijuana is a gateway drug and while she would rather smoke a
joint than vape, she, too, ended up using heroin, had no self-esteem and said
she sometimes didn't care if she lived or died. She wound up in trouble and
through the sheriff's program is managing to stay sober.

Both former users said they don't recommend getting involved with drugs at all
and warned that anyone about to make the leap from pot to opioids ought to
rethink that choice and get help.

The sheriff said he believes students could be vaping and doing it around
unsuspecting adults. The pens used to vape are smokeless, pretty much odorless
and it takes just a few seconds to ""take a hit.""

The concentrate being vaped allows drug dealers to use the entire marijuana
plant to make the dabs or shatter. Parts of the plant that would normally be
discarded are stripped down with butane and made into the material for vaping,
so marijuana growers get more bang for their buck, Zach explained.

A gram of dabs or shatter costs about $50, the same as an eight of a gram of
leafy pot purchased in a bag for smoking, Zach said.

The fact that the vaping pens and the dabs or shatter are so readily available,
are unregulated and can be easily used without drawing attention which, Sheriff
Evangelidis said, is something parents should know.

""We're trying to raise awareness of this,"" he said. ""There are always new
developments in the drug culture. We've seen Molly, heroin and now this, and the
kids usually know a lot about it before we do.""

Editorial: Vaping supplies deserve state oversight

SECTION: NEWS; Opinion; Editorials

LENGTH: 425 words","


There are only two reasons why any state that cared at all about the health of
its citizens would allow the sale of electronic cigarettes, vaping cartridges
and associated paraphernalia within its borders.

The good reason is that, wisely used, e-cigarettes indeed have the potential to
help poor souls who have been unable to quit their tobacco addiction by any
other means. E-cigs can help smokers cut down on their tobacco intake, avoid
some of the other nasty chemicals that piggy-back into their systems by
attaching themselves to the craved nicotine and, with luck and perseverance,
even quit altogether.

The not-so-good reason is that if vaping supplies aren't sold in legal,
regulated commerce, they will become a booming black market business, beyond the
reach of efforts to maximize the technology's effectiveness and minimize its
harm. And the potential for harm is large when vaping is taken up by people,
mostly young people attracted to the often candy-flavored varieties, who never
smoked before.

Then, e-cigs are just another nicotine delivery system, addictive, poisonous and
worthy of government oversight.

The Utah State Health Department has developed proposed regulations for the sale
of vaping supplies. While the marketers who worked with the department's review
have signed off on the draft, others in the businesses Monday appealed to a
legislative committee to block at least some of the proposed regulations.

Of primary concern, apparently, is a rule that would require prominent labeling
of vaping cartridges as containing dangerous and addictive substances ccc which
they do ccc that should be kept away from children and pets ccc which they
should.

Because maybe 80 percent of those refills are made overseas, lawmaker were told,
manufacturers participating in a global market won't want to bother attaching
such labels to the small portion of their product line destined for Utah. And
that would dry up the state's supply.

It was more than troubling that some members of the committee seemed more
concerned about keeping the e-cig dealers cash flow up than they were about
public health.

Health department representatives said the input they heard from e-cig dealers
was that the labeling requirement wouldn't be a problem. They also noted that
the rules would not take effect until July, giving everyone time to either
comply or explain why they couldn't.

E-cigs are not just another consumer product. They are a trendy new spin on a
very old addictive drug. They should be viewed skeptically by government, and
regulated strictly.

Antagonism towards vaping unjustifiable

BYLINE: The Canberra Times

SECTION: A; Pg. B002

LENGTH: 279  words","


Antagonism towards vaping unjustifiable The article ""Cautious law change to
vaporise e-cigarette"" (October 21, p3) confirms government and public health
lobbyists are not concerned for the health of consumers avoiding potential harm
from tobacco smoke by using personal vaporisers, but with acts which mimic
smoking.

Personal vaporisers are not tobacco products, and only feeble generalised
assertions of possible health risk are offered to justify controlling these
products as if they were tobacco.

The anti-tobacco and now anti-vaping dictators quoted in the article displayed
the usual bias, unimaginatively proposing another target for decades- old
taxpayer-funded campaigns piously haranguing the public to ""quit or die"".

If public health is the aim, why is support absent for a product proven to
assist reduction or cessation of tobacco consumption much more effectively than
current subsidised smoking ""cures""?

Balance, perspective and tolerance are long overdue in the mostly one-sided
tobacco control debate: vaping is obviously not smoking tobacco, is
comparatively harmless, and inadequate justification has been provided for
treating vaping as if it causes health consequences similar to tobacco
consumption.

M. Jarratt, Weston Creek Candid humour I, too, have wondered about the can that
David Pope draws on Malcolm's head (Letters, October 22). When it first
appeared, I thought it was a can of worms from which all but one had escaped,
but the spiral structure of the filament shows it cannot be a worm.

It is to remind us of Malcolm's success as communications minister in the Abbott
government of 2013, especially with the NBN roll-out.

E-cigarette firms fear Euro plans could bankrupt them;

VAPING firm director Matt Balster fears electronic cigarette businesses could go
bust if new European Union rules are brought into force.

All vaping products and e-liquids would have to be thoroughly tested if the
rules are enforced, and producers would have to tell the authorities six months
before their products are put on the market. The batch tests would effectively
rule out ""legitimate"" home-brewed e-liquids, and could cost firms hundreds of
pounds for each flavour they produce, according to Mr Balster, director of Vape
It Easy in Space Business Centre.

He said the new rules could force many vaping companies in Gloucestershire and
the UK out of business and the industry would never be the same again if the
rules are brought into force.

He said electronic cigarettes are ""life-saving"" and the new rules could force
many users back to smoking.

Mr Balster, pictured, said: ""These new laws are going to run smaller companies
out of business. Vaping as we know it would cease to exist.

""We know how to get people off smoking and the types of products they need. But
if the new law comes into force we would have to close our shop. There are
people's lives at stake.

""There are half-a-dozen vaping shops in Gloucester alone. It would mean a lot of
people going back to smoking and a lot of jobs being lost.""

The European Union is trying to implement its Tobacco Products Directive on May
20 next year after it was adopted by the European Parliament in 2014.

But a legal challenge against Article 20 of the directive has been launched by
electronic cigarette manufacturer Totally Wicked, based in Blackburn, which says
the rules would put its industry at an unfair disadvantage. The law would mean
the nicotine content in e-liquid would not be allowed to exceed 20 milligrams
per millilitre.

Businesses would be banned from promoting their vaping products in print, radio
and TV.

E-liquid would only be able to be sold in pre-filled cartridges containing up to
two millilitres, or refillable containers containing 10 millilitres or less. The
Tobacco Products Directive was voted in by the European Parliament after an
estimated 700,000 premature deaths are caused by smoking across the EU each
year. The new rules would also ban flavoured cigarettes, and health warnings
would cover 65 per cent of the front and back of all cigarette packets.

Q My 16-year-old daughter is ""vaping."" Have you heard of this? How can I
persuade her it's not a good idea? - Gretchen F., Lexington, Ky.

AWe confess, we had to do some research on this one! But after smoking out the
information, we hope we can help you persuade your teen that using electronic
cigarettes can have consequences.

For those of you who need a quick course on vaping: It's a hipster version of
smoking tobacco. Retail ""vaporiums"" sell flavoured vapour cartridges, with or
without nicotine.

Placed in high-tech gadgets with names such as EGO and iTaste, the cartridges
are battery-activated to produce a smokeless cloud when you inhale.

The vaping liquids are sometimes made with propylene glycol (other bases are
used, but not all companies say what they are). Animal research indicates
inhaling this chemical may affect fertility and the health of offspring. You
also can tell your daughter one study found that five minutes of vaping lowers
lung function as much as smoking a conventional cigarette.

In its favour, this cloud of vapour doesn't contain the 60 known carcinogens
found in tobacco smoke, and it may be a way to kick tobacco (it works for some
folks).

But as a general rule, putting anything besides relatively clean air into your
lungs can lead to a roster of complications, depending on what's inhaled. If
your daughter wants to feel hip, suggest non-permanent, vegetable-based hair
colour (try red! blue!); you can live with that, and so can she, right? And for
stress relief, suggest joining an after-school athletic program or doing yoga
together.

She'll learn how important it is to inhale without extra chemicals in every
breath - and appreciate how much you want to help.

How to stay relevant in 2015? Forget coffee and shave off your beard;
As a new year dawns, Adam Gabbatt takes a look at trends and suggests bold ways
to ensure you stand out in the crowd and stay ahead of the curve

BYLINE: Adam Gabbatt

SECTION: CULTURE

LENGTH: 706 words","


There's a new year approaching, bringing with it all the usual questions and
reflections. Where is my relationship going? How long should my beard be? When
is it time for a career change? Is flannel still in vogue? All legitimate
concerns, sure, and here we will aim to solve at least some of them with a great
Guardian guide on how to stay on-trend in 2015.

Coffee is over

Coffee is over, so focus on the tea. Companies like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts
are jostling to invest in tea as Americans drink 20% more of it than they did
ten years ago, while coffee consumption has flatlined. To the dismay of some, it
is not old-fashioned ""normal"" tea (breakfast tea with milk) that is gaining
popularity but stuff like Monkey Picked Oolong Tea and kombucha. Either one of
those should see you right. To be really ahead of the curve in 2015 though, the
image-conscious should apparently opt for Switchel. Organic Authority and Modern
Farmer both say so. Switchel is neither coffee nor tea but a beverage of
mysterious origin that consists of water, ginger, cider vinegar and molasses or
brown sugar. Soon to be seen everywhere (AKA Brooklyn).

Vape wasn't just the word of the year; it's a way of life

Craft ale has enjoyed a relatively lengthy, happy time in the sun, so it's time
to shove it aside and move on to something else. That thing is vaping alcohol.
The Vapshot mini is the best known vaping product. It only costs $700 (£449). It
will vaporise whatever booze stuff you put in it. The advantage of vaping is
that you get drunk really quickly because the alcohol almost immediately enters
your bloodstream - a bit like doing a shot directly into your eyeball but
without the sting. The disadvantage of vaping is that it is quite dangerous
because the alcohol almost immediately enters your bloodstream. That and the
price, and that the drunk feeling reportedly only lasts about 30 seconds. Still.
Vaping. Woo!

What on earth am I gonna do with my beard?

2014 was a rough year for beards. Every Tom, Dick and Prince Harry grew one,
meaning, of course, that it became uncool. So much so that the end of the beard
was even declared in some quarters. In 2015 the discerning man has a couple of
choices. He could decide to go full lumbersexual - which essentially means grow
a beard and wear a flannel shirt - or shave it off and be done with it. Clean
shaven may prove to be the more novel look. However, for those looking beyond
the yearly fashion ebb and flow and considering instead the era-defining look,
then it is clear that the beard should be retained. When culture historians look
back at the period between 2010 and 2020, it is beards they will think of. Only
beards - not Isis or Ebola or Sony hacks or millennials.

iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy?

Neither. Both are rubbish. Get an old-school flip phone. Vogue's Anna Wintour
has one. So does Iggy Pop. To be as cool as them, what you should really do is
go to a website like Vintage Mobile, which will sell you a ten-year-old
flip-phone for not far off the same price it cost ten years ago. If a flipping
mechanism is not for you, then you could buy a really, really old-school phone
like a ""Retro Brick phone"". As you'd expect, it looks a little bit retro, and a
little bit like a brick, but appears to work and even has a little aerial.
Perfect for the coffee shop! If it is fear of seeming pretentious that is
putting you off using an old phone, then fear not. According to the Guardian,
whoever that is, using an old phone means you are safer from phone hacks, which
lends a legitimacy to the whole enterprise.

What about my tunes?

Flip, or clamshell, phones have little to no music capability, opening up a
world of possibilities for one's portable music maker. Cassette players are a
little passe at this stage, as are mobile record players since that photo that
appeared on BuzzFeed. No, what you want to do is order an iPod Classic MP3
player. The version that was available, unchanged since 2006 until Apple pulled
it in September. What the Daily Mail describes as ""music fans"" are now
""clamouring"" to buy the device, which has double the capacity of any current
iPods being made. The iPod Classic used to retail for around $250, but now it
could be yours for between $450 and $900.

Oregon: KOIN 6: Should vaping in public go up in smoke?

LENGTH: 998  words","

DATELINE: Salem


Portland State University, The State of Oregon has issued the following News
release:

Whenever Michael Hamberg went to the Westfield Vancouver Mall, he'd see vapor
rising from the e-cigarette kiosk.

The kiosk attendants, he said, ""were always blowing vapors in the air."" He said
the vapor caused him throat irritation and he was worried about the impact on
his two young daughters.

""I was just kind of concerned about my family being there with the health
issues,"" he said.

He said he tried to contact the Westfield Vancouver Mall's management about the
issue, but ""I haven't got a response.""

The marketing director for the mall declined an interview and had no comment on
the topic when contacted by KOIN 6 News.

The owner of the Life-Wise Vapor kiosk in the mall also had no comment for KOIN
6 News.

The law

A young man vapes at a kiosk in the Westfield Vancouver Mall, December 2014
(KOIN 6 News)

Washington's law regarding smoking in public places passed in 2005. It does not
ban e-cigarettes, which appeared on the market about two years later.

The Washington Department of Health said it's up to local governments to make
the call about e-cigarettes. King, Pierce and Grant counties, plus Pasco City,
don't allow vaping indoors.

""Vancouver doesn't have that kind of ban,"" said Paul Davis of the tobacco
prevention control section of the Washington Department of Health. ""We do get a
number of calls asking why is it that people can use these products.""

An employee of the Life-Wise Vapor kiosk told KOIN 6 News some of the liquids
are infused with caffeine and melatonin.

Davis thinks that's a problem.

""I think when you have a chemical that people are inhaling into their lungs and
it's a psychoactive chemical and it doesn't have any regulation or any
protection or prevention for kids, that's a cause for concern.""

Proposed legislation

Flavored products for e-cigarettes, December 2014 (KOIN 6 News)

There are five proposed bills in Washington and seven in Oregon about vaping in
this upcoming legislative session. Most of those are about regulating
e-cigarettes to prevent minors from easily accessing them. (A list of the
proposed legislation is listed at the bottom of this article.)

But there is nothing in the proposed legislation to stop vaping indoors.

In Vancouver, the use of any tobacco product in a park is punishable by law with
a fine of up to $1,000.

Mayor Tim Leavitt told KOIN 6 News he just heard about the indoor vaping at the
Westfield Vancouver Mall and he said the city will now consider banning indoor
vaping.

""Our city manager has been tasked with doing some research,"" Leavitt said.

Clark County Councillor Tom Mielke had no idea vaping was allowed in the mall.
""I'm really surprised because that's an indoor area,"" he said.

Mielke told KOIN 6 News Clark County will likely pass an ordinance preventing
vaping in public places ""probably within a month or two.""

PSU Study

Portland State University professors Dr. James Pankow and Dr. David Peyton
published studies in the New England Journal of Medicine about vaping (KOIN 6
News)

Portland State University professors Dr. James Pankow and Dr. David Peyton
published studies in the New England Journal of Medicine about vaping.

Pankow studied flavor chemicals in vaping liquids and said they are not safe for
inhaling. In some of the liquids, the study found the flavorant level is very
high.

""Anyone who is around an e-cigarette user is being exposed to the same chemicals
as the user, and it's not just water vapor. It's all the chemicals and the
flavorants,"" Pankow told KOIN 6 News. ""It's a class of chemical, an aldehyde,
are known respiratory irritants.""

Peyton's study discovered a carcinogen.

""We saw up to 15 times as much formaldehyde as one study saw in cigarette
smoke,"" he said.

The researchers said they have found several more health concerns in
e-cigarettes and plan to publish more studies in the next few months.

KOIN 6 News asked several e-cigarette manufacturers about their products, but
they declined to be interviewed.

However, Phil Daman, the chairman and president of the Smoke-Free Alternatives
Trade Association, said he was familiar with the recent research.

""The study was in no way, shape or form designed to examine whether or not
electronic cigarettes were more harmful than smoking,"" Daman told KOIN 6 News.

The concerned parent

Michael Hamberg hopes the Vancouver city leaders follow suit so no vaping will
be inside the mall.

""It seems like a family environment like a mall, they shouldn't have something
like that,"" he said.

Vaping is more than smoke and mirrors

Vaping is growing more popular in Shanghai's expat community. Photo: CFP


Seated in the back room of The Shed bar in Jing'an district, Gavin Llewellyn
took a drag from a rectangular metal box and blew out a cloud thick enough to
hide behind. The avuncular Australian was demonstrating the massive billows that
one can create with a souped-up electronic cigarette.Llewellyn's demonstrations,
which included building electronic cigarette components, were part of the
Shanghai Vape Meet on December 13, an event devoted to electronic cigarettes and
their use - vaping.Although electronic cigarettes remain little more than a
curiosity in China, the market has exploded elsewhere. Reuters reported in
January that electronic cigarette sales in the US grew 115 percent each year
from 2009 to 2012 and could jump by as much as 240 percent this year.As the
market for electronic cigarettes has grown in other countries, vaping has become
more popular in Shanghai's expat community. The Shanghai Vape Meet was a sign of
this. The event was organized by Shanghai Vape and the Vapina Vape Club, two
vendors of vaping products in Shanghai.

Llewellyn works for the latter.There are many types of electronic cigarettes, or
vapes. One of the most popular is a short metal tube that resembles a
conventional cigarette. In the vaping community, it's known as a cigalike, and
is sold under popular brands like Blu. Most of the people at this meeting had
already moved on to more sophisticated devices that use more powerful batteries
and more complex tank systems, including clearomizers and rebuildable
atomizers.Electronic cigarettes all work more or less the same way. A battery
shoots electricity through a metal coil, which heats up the e-liquid and turns
it into vapor so it can be inhaled, giving the user a hit of nicotine. But
unlike conventional cigarettes, there's no combustion. Because nothing burns,
the vapor is free of many of the harmful side effects of tobacco smoke. Still,
experts say more research needs to be done on vaping to ensure it's completely
safe. Most of the people at the meeting were current or former cigarette
smokers.Considering the growing prevalence of electronic cigarettes and their
relative novelty in Shanghai, the Global Times attended the vape meet to find
out why people decide to start vaping and if they have any concerns.

Sean Dickinson, owner of Shanghai Vape, the UK

I was a smoker for about 16 or 17 years. The first time I had an electronic
cigarette was about four years ago when one of my Chinese friends bought me a
cigalike. And it was terrible. I used it once or twice when I was having a
drink. I didn't know how strong the nicotine was or whether there was any
nicotine in it. The feeling wasn't great. And then earlier this year, one of my
friends was using a clearomizer he had got from a vape market. I was smoking
cigarettes, but he seemed very happy with his vape. So I started using one of
his spares. And that was probably in January or February of this year. After
that I went back to the UK and I stocked up on more cigalikes. And they were OK,
but they weren't strong enough for me. So I did some more research, and
eventually, I bought one of the Kanger EVODs. And that's one of the reasons why
I sell it. Because that's what helped me stop smoking. So in about May, I
started to use that, and gradually, over the next couple of months, I reduced my
cigarette intake. And the last cigarette I had was in July. So, I'm very happy
now.The business was something that I fell into. Because I was using vapes, all
my friends would ask me: ""Where did you get that from? Can you buy me one?"" So
it didn't start a business. It was helping people out. And that's still the
philosophy. It's not about trying to make loads of money. It's about trying to
help people make better decisions.

Laurent Montcoutie, commodities worker, France

This is my first vape meet. I'm new to vaping. It's very popular in Europe and
very popular in France. In China, I thought I would try to smoke less, but the
opposite turned out to be true. You just smoke more here because it is easier.
You can smoke everywhere. I wanted to do something about it, and I had tried
other things like patches and gums, but wasn't really successful. So, I decided
to try vaping. I thought it was pretty effective. I liked it. So I continued
vaping and smoking at the same time, but smoking less, and then just vaping.I
haven't smoked for two months. I used to smoke one to two packs a day.Once I got
interested in vaping, I read a lot about it, and in France I heard a lot about
it. So I knew it was effective. So that was not the issue. The issue was whether
it was healthy. So I tried to read a lot about it. And I still have a little bit
of concern about vaping in the long term.I like it. I enjoy it. I want to do it
for a few months, a year, two years maybe. But I also want to quit vaping at
some point. Wang Long, teacher, the USI quit smoking cold turkey two weeks ago.
It will be almost 10 years since I started smoking. I started very young. I was
up to about a half pack a day of 12 milligram cigarettes. And I then got sick.
But I kept smoking while sick. That's when you realize that you're disgusting.A
lot of my buddies would whip out a Blu e-cig, or a gas station one. I tried
that, and it was no substitute. Then I went online and did some more research.
And it interested me and I decided to try it out. It's no real substitute for a
warm, throat-hitting cigarette, but honestly, my goal is to quit, not to find a
substitute. It's easy to transfer an addiction.

Gavin Llewellyn, Vapina Vape Club, Australia

When I moved to China, the first thing I noticed was the cigarettes were cheap.
Being a smoker this was unfortunately good news for me, but obviously not for my
health.I started vaping after an American, Christian Ong, the founder of the
Vapina Vape Club, sent me my first basic setup with e-juice from the US. I work
now closely with Chris to get this out there in China and to help others quit
smoking. It has sort of become a personal goal now of mine.Some people stick
with the ego setups because they're small and similar in size to that of a
cigarette. You can have a vape when you feel like a cigarette and the liquid
that contains nicotine can satisfy the craving. Some people stay on higher
nicotine, 24 milligrams, and have the occasional vape and that's enough. I am
now down to 6 milligrams or 3 milligrams of nicotine, but more and more now I'm
actually enjoying the variety of flavors and not chasing the nicotine anymore.I
haven't smoked a cigarette since I bought this kit and I am now coming up to
eight months. I was a pack and a half a day smoker and I smoked for 10 years
before trying e-cigarettes.

Simeon Duke, media employee, the US

I smoked for about two years and when I run out of liquid, I still smoke - I
admit it. Because I still use nicotine, I need my hit. Usually, when I go out
with my friends and I run out of liquid or my battery dies, I'll ask for a
cigarette after 20 or 30 minutes. But I'll just smoke half of it because I can't
handle the taste. I just get the quick fix and then throw it away.My friend
introduced vaping to me. In the beginning, I didn't really get a lot of help
about battery safety or what kind of liquid I should use. I assumed I should go
with a liquid with a higher level of nicotine. So I started on 24 milligrams. At
the same time, it wasn't the same hit as you would get with a cigarette.I
actually had a lot of questions. And I wanted to stop smoking, so I did some
research on YouTube and after that it was easier to decide what kind of liquid I
should use.

Ralph Hendry, kindergarten teacher, the UK

I was never a heavy smoker. I only smoked one or two cigarettes a day. And when
I drank, I smoked more, but never a ludicrous amount of cigarettes.I started
vaping two or three months ago. I had seen it before, but all the choices are a
bit much. I'm friends with Sean, and when he started, he explained everything to
me - what it was about and how it worked. It seemed like a good idea.I liked the
different flavors the most. I liked that you can switch it up. Also, I don't
like to smoke in my house. My girlfriend doesn't smoke, so if I smoke inside,
the whole house stinks. And just one cigarette will stink up the place. But I
can sit on the sofa, watch TV and vape and it's not a problem.

Benjamin Briandet, software engineer, the US

I heard about the event online. And I was curious because I'm really into
tinkering with things. I've used e-cigarettes, but I'm not really a big smoker.
I'm more drawn to the tinkering. I'm really into 3D printing and automotive
stuff, like I have a motorcycle that I like to work on. I like anything that you
can take off the shelf and make it more personalized - anything that makes it
more yours.So I was curious. On the website, they were talking about teaching
people how to blow big clouds, how to make their own custom coils and how to
make a drip. So I decided to come down and see what they're doing.It's cool. I
watched a guy rebuild a coil. I had never seen these things disassembled before.
So I was really interested to see what goes on. It was just a really interesting
look into this culture that I didn't know existed.

Denver Post: No public vaping ban -- yet

SECTION: OPINION; Columnists

LENGTH: 327 words","


New federal rules around electronic cigarettes that ban sales to minors and
require disclosure of ingredients are practical and necessary for the
increasingly popular smokeless devices.

But local laws banning the use of e-cigarettes in every place where smoking is
prohibited, such as restaurants, bars or within 20 feet of entrances, are a
premature overreaction.

Recently, Lakewood and Fort Collins applied their public smoking restrictions to
e-cigarettes. Golden, Louisville, Commerce City and Durango are planning on
doing the same.

There is no dispute around the harmful effects of smoking tobacco or the
problems associated with secondhand smoke.

Battery-powered e-cigarettes that turn liquid nicotine into vapor emit no smoke.
Research has yet to conclude secondhand inhalation from vape equipment has ill
effects that should be the basis of public vaping bans.

A German study that looked at whether e-cigarettes cause ""passive vaping"" found
virtually no quantifiable levels of the 20 volatile organic compounds present in
cigarette smoke.

The German Cancer Research Center, however, did detect the minute presence of
metals and carcinogenic chemicals in the vapors. So further study is warranted.

Part of the problem for e-cigarettes is that the user may appear to be smoking,
which is why cities are enacting regulations similar to tobacco.

Colorado already bans e-cig sales to anyone 18 or younger. And the federal
government would be wise to ban marketing to teens, including flavors and
colorful packaging aimed at youngsters.

Private businesses should be allowed to prohibit vaping and the practice should
be banned from government facilities. The U.S. Department of Transportation
banned vaping in 2011. Amtrak also has prohibited it.

But bars, restaurants, bingo halls, concert venues and bowling alleys should be
allowed, for the time being, to permit the practice if they want, unless further
research proves the activity dangerous to the non-vaping public.

Understanding of local, state laws regarding e-cigarettes often hazy

BYLINE: Marissa Harshman Columbian staff writer; Clark County Public Health

SECTION: NORTH COUNTY; Pg. NC4

LENGTH: 636 words","



HIGHLIGHT: Clark County Public Health made new ""No Smoking"" signs to include
language prohibiting the use of electronic cigarettes. The health department is
distributing the signs to local businesses that prohibit e-cigarette use.


Smoking has long been banned inside public places. But with the emergence and
surging popularity of electronic cigarettes, local public health officials are
fielding a common question among business owners: What about vaping?Electronic
cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-operated devices that vaporize liquid
nicotine, which is then inhaled by the user. The act of using the devices has
been coined ""vaping.""Theresa Cross, a health educator for Clark County Public
Health's chronic disease prevention program, receives a few calls each month
from employers, employees and the public asking about the legality of using
e-cigarettes inside private businesses.""The state smoking ban doesn't cover
these devices,"" Cross said of e-cigarettes.In December 2005, the Smoking in
Public Places law (formerly the Washington Clean Indoor Air Act) went into
effect, making it illegal to smoke in all indoor public places and workplaces
in Washington.That was before electronic cigarettes appeared on the market.


The current state law does not prohibit e-cigarettes or vaping.King and Spokane
counties have modified their local ordinances to prohibit the use of
e-cigarettes anywhere cigarette smoking is prohibited. Clark County has
prohibited the sale of e-cigarettes to minors but has not placed restrictions
on their use by adults.But that doesn't mean business owners can't prohibit
vaping.Some people have argued business owners can't prohibit the devices
because they're not included in the state law. That, Cross said, isn't the
case.""They don't have to allow them if they don't want to,"" she said.And public
health officials encourage businesses to prohibit vaping anywhere smoking is
prohibited for several reasons.For starters, health officials worry the
increased use of e-cigarettes will once again normalize smoking, especially
among kids and teens, and threaten the declining smoking rates, Cross said. In
addition, electronic cigarette use inside businesses can cause confusion if
customers think a person is smoking a tobacco cigarette, she said.Finally, the
long-term health affects of the exhaled steam - both on those vaping and others
in the area - is still unknown, Cross said.""It is steam, but it contains other
components,"" Cross said. ""We don't always know how much is in it because
they're not regulated.""
Education effort
Clark County Public Health is now working to educate business owners about
their rights regarding e-cigarettes.The health department has long offered
businesses ""No smoking"" signs for their windows. A couple of months ago, they
updated the signs.The green signs now say, ""No smoking, including electronic
cigarettes."" Health officials are offering the signs to any local business that
wants them. They're also distributing fact sheets, outlining business owners'
rights regarding e-cigarettes.Russell Brent, owner of Mill Creek Pub in Battle
Ground, has always prohibited the use of electronic cigarettes in his
restaurant but never publicized the policy. He recently made the rules clear,
placing one of the health department's new signs in the restaurant window.For
Brent, the decision to prohibit e-cigarettes was an easy one.The nicotine in
e-cigarettes comes in a variety of flavors, such as chocolate, vanilla,
strawberry, cherry and mint. The steam that users exhale holds that scent and
can interfere with other diners in the restaurant.""If someone is smoking an
e-cigarette, it's going to affect your dining experience,"" Brent said.Brent
hasn't received any push-back over the policy. Most customers are respectful
and take their electronic cigarettes out to the patio, just as they would with
a cigarette, he said.""In the restaurant business, it's a no-brainer,"" he said
of the policy.

Wheaton council bans e-cigarettes, vaping devices

BYLINE: By Jessica Cilella jcilella@dailyherald.com

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 0

LENGTH: 471 words","


E-cigarettes and other vaping devices are now restricted in certain areas of
Wheaton.

The city council approved a new smoke- and vape-free ordinance in a 5-0 vote
Monday in an effort to ""protect the public health, comfort and environment"" and
ensure nonsmokers and non-vapers can ""breathe air free from the hazardous
effects of secondhand smoke and alternative nicotine products."" Mayor Michael
Gresk and Councilman Todd Scalzo were absent.

E-cigarettes often mimic the look of a tobacco cigarette, with a plastic or
glass rod, but they do not contain tar or produce a combustible smoke. The
devices create a liquid-based mist that delivers the nicotine, flavor and other
chemicals to the user through inhalation.

Like other tobacco products in Wheaton, e-cigarettes are now banned from all
enclosed public places and places of employment; in open-air public dining
areas; at outdoor events; in Adams and Memorial parks; on public sidewalks
within 25 feet of public entrances and open-air dining areas; and within 25 feet
of an outdoor venue during an outdoor event.

Exemptions were granted to retailers whose principal business is the retail sale
of tobacco and tobacco-related products.

Anyone who smokes or vapes in areas where it is prohibited will now face fines
between $100 and $250 per offense. Owners, managers and operators of any space
that permits smoking or vaping where it is prohibited by the city will face a
fine of $250 or more for the first violation and at least $500 for the second
violation within a year.

The ordinance also calls for owners to post ""no smoking or vaping"" signs in
areas where smoking and vaping are prohibited.

According to the ordinance, the council adopted findings from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, or FDA, that said the solution used in e-cigarettes
contains toxic chemicals found in antifreeze and other cancer-causing chemicals,
as well as findings from the New England Journal of Medicine that said pre-
vaping liquid breaks down into formaldehyde.

One resident, Kraig Knudsen, spoke against the ordinance. He said he has worked
in the tobacco industry for more than 30 years and while he believes the intent
of the city's ordinance is good, it might lead to ""unintended consequences.""

""Most users of these products are using them in an effort to reduce or eliminate
their dependency on nicotine entirely,"" he said. ""You'd be limiting people that
are using these products as a cessation device.""

Councilwoman Suzanne Fitch noted, however, that the ""alternative nicotine
products"" banned by the city in the ordinance excludes any product approved by
the FDA as a tobacco cessation product or tobacco dependency product.

""Of course we don't want to ban something that's going to help people to quit
smoking, but I think that this definition is well-drafted in that regard,"" she
said.

Fightin Phils to install vaping lounge at FirstEnergy Stadium

SECTION: SPORTS

June 17--The Reading Fightin Phils announced Tuesday that they are teaming with
a Hamburg-area e-cigarette shop to install a ""vaping lounge"" at FirstEnergy
Stadium.

The Vape Lounge in America's Classic Ballpark could be the first in any
professional baseball park in the country, team officials said in a prepared
statement.

The lounge, which will be outdoors near the smoking area just outside the
ballpark, is a partnership between the Fightins and Sabor Vapors on Old Route 22
in Windsor Township just outside of Hamburg.

""The Vape Lounge is another way of accommodating our fans,"" said Eric Scarcella,
Fightins spokesman.

Not everyone is excited about a vaping lounge in the local ballpark.

""The American Lung Association is extremely disappointed in the addition of a
vape lounge at the Reading Fightin Phils stadium,"" said Deborah Brown, president
and CEO of the American Lung Association of the Mid-Atlantic.

Brown cited statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention that show e-cigarette use has tripled in the past year among youths.

""Places like Sabor Vapors market flavors such as Apple Jacks cereal, Blue Cotton
Candy, Bubblegum and Candy Apple, all appealing directly to youth,"" she said.
""These marketing tactics do not belong in a baseball stadium.""

Ishmael Rivera, who together with his wife, Amelia, co-own Sabor Vapors, said
the vaping lounge at the ballpark was the idea of Scott Hunsicker, team general
manager.

However, in a press release he said fans who vape didn't want to be exposed to
secondhand smoke in the smoking area.

Rivera said many of his customers are looking to quit smoking by using the
vaporizers, which deliver varying levels of nicotine.

""Some customers buy a starter kit and use that to quit,"" he said. ""Others get
into it as a hobby.""

Dr. Richard Bell, a retired West Reading pulmonologist, said he doesn't get how
a vaping lounge fits in a minor league ballpark.

""I would hope they would not have anyone under 21 in that lounge,"" Bell said.

As far as people getting sick from breathing secondhand vapors, he said he
doesn't know if that is dangerous or not.

""What it does is glamorize smoking,"" Bell said. ""From what all the health care
companies have been trying to accomplish over the years, it (the lounge) just
doesn't make sense.""

Mercer County Clean Indoor Air Regulation: Ban on use of 'vaping' devices to be
considered

BYLINE: Greg Jordan, Bluefield Daily Telegraph, W.Va.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 682 words","


April 09--GREEN VALLEY -- Smokers, nonsmokers, and people who use electronic
nicotine devices will be able to comment soon about whether clean indoor
regulations limiting public places where people can smoke should also apply to
e-devices.

Members of the Mercer County Health Department voted unanimously Wednesday to
consider amending the county Clean Indoor Air Regulation to include e-cigarettes
and other electronic nicotine devices.

The devices would not be allowed in the same public places where smoking is now
prohibited.

""In restaurants where you can't smoke and public places smoking is not allowed,
these would not be allowed, either,"" Susan Kadar, Mercer County Health
Department administrator, said after the meeting. Notices will be posted in
public and published in the Bluefield Daily Telegraph and other media. Residents
will have 30 days after the publication to comment on the proposed amendments.

Stores selling devices and supplies for them, also known as vaping shops, would
be added to the list of establishments where smoking is not regulated, Kadar
said. This list includes businesses such as free standing bars, free standing
video lottery rooms, private residences, designated hotel and motel rooms for
guests, retail tobacco shops and fraternal organizations.

Tony Colosi, a co-owner of The Sly Foxx in Princeton, said getting stores like
his on the list of places where smoking is permitted was one of his goals.

""It's not a bad policy, but it's not the best solution,"" he said after the
meeting. ""The best solution is to write a separate policy. It's not smoking,
it's vaping.""

Colosi invited Robert and Marta Hays, owners of Vandalia Mist, a company that
manufactures liquids for the vapor devices, to speak before the board. In the
presentation, Robert Hays said nicotine itself is not dangerous, and that the
health risks from smoking comes from the chemicals in the smoke. The ingredients
in ""vaping"" liquid consist of nicotine, flavoring, vegetable glycerin and
propylene glycol; the latter two products are used in cosmetics and products
often found in grocery stores.

Board member Gene Buckner, who also serves on the Mercer County Commission,
asked how thoroughly the devices and their liquids had been studied. Robert Hays
said e-cigarettes first became available in 2008, and the first vaping shops
opened in West Virginia last year. Board members also asked about possible risks
and whether studies have been done concerning possible long-term effects.

Board member Dr. Robert Stevens asked about the possible effects of second-hand
nicotine vapor. Marta Hays said one study by the University of Kentucky showed
the same chemicals found in the devices' vapor can also be found ""in the air
we're breathing right now.""

Doris Irwin, a retired health department employee, shared a photograph of her
brother, Mike, he died recently from cancer. He started smoking at age 9, and
""was unable to stop right up to the end,"" she said.

Smoking has decreased considerable since indoor air regulations went into place,
Irwin stated.

""In 1965 about 42 percent of the U.S. population smoked. Today, largely due to
the efforts of public health, it has been reduced to about 19 percent,"" Irwin
said. ""Bans on smoking in public have helped drive those smoking rates down.
Here today, I'm in support of the smoking ban. It saves lives and nonsmokers as
well as smokers.""

Irwin said she was worried that vaping could draw more young people to nicotine
addiction.

""I have concerns that the nicotine in vaping is currently unregulated by the
FDA, and is easily available to children,"" she said. ""I'm worried that the
better taste and smell will attract children like my brother Mike at age 9 into
early addiction and will turn back the real progress we've made in public
health.""

Colosi said West Virginia already has regulations prohibiting the sale of the
devices or nicotine liquid to people less than 18 years old.

Vaping could be stubbed out by EU - claim

SECTION: AGENCY:OTHER; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 235  words","


Electronic cigarette businesses could go bust if new European Union rules are
brought into force, according to the director of a West vaping firm.

All vaping products and 'e-liquids' would have to be thoroughly tested if the
rules are enforced, and producers would have to tell the authorities six months
before their products are put on the market.

The batch tests would effectively rule out ""legitimate"" home-brewed e-liquids,
and could cost firms hundreds of pounds for each flavour they produce, according
to Matt Balster, director of Vape It Easy, based in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire.

Mr Balster said the new rules could force many vaping companies out of business
and the industry would never be the same again if the rules are brought into
force.

He said electronic cigarettes are ""life-saving"" and the new rules could force
many users back to smoking.

Mr Balster said: ""These new laws are going to run many smaller companies out of
business. Vaping as we know it would cease to exist.

""We know how to get people off smoking and the types of products they need. But
if the new law comes into force we would have to close our shop. There are
people's lives at stake.""

The European Union is trying to implement its Tobacco Products Directive on May
20 next year after it was adopted by the European Parliament in 2014. But a
legal challenge against Article 20 of the directive has been launched by
manufacturers.

Vaping handed a veto

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA



HIGHLIGHT: Santa Monica will create an e-cig law that mirrors a ban on smoking
tobacco.


  Despite opposition from two dozen speakers, the City Council unanimously voted
recently to craft a law that will treat electronic cigarettes like tobacco
cigarettes, limiting the places the devices can be used.

The city claimed it could tighten governance of e-cigarettes because of their
unregulated marketing as well as the enforcement confusion with public smoking
and the lack of research on the health and safety of the electronic devices.

The majority of speakers at City Hall June 24 were e-cigarette shop owners and
employees or e-cigarette users. They said using e-cigarettes - known as vaping -
had gotten them away from smoking a pack a day of traditional cigarettes and
created a sense of community for people trying to find tobacco alternatives.

""Many cities are vilifying this lifesaving technology,"" e-cigarette user Jay Oku
said.

Those opposed to the city's planned rules argued against notions that candy
flavors of the liquid-nicotine used in e-cigarettes attract kids to vaping, and
they said that secondhand vapors are not harmful. E-cigarette shop owners claim
the vast majority of their patrons are trying to stop smoking cigarettes.

""I haven't touched a cigarette in years because I switched to vaping,"" Justin
Renken said. ""I don't want you to stigmatize it with legislation that groups it
with this dangerous habit of smoking.""

Two e-cigarette shops - Fix Vapor and Vapor Delight - voiced concern about
losing the ability to vape inside the shops, which could affect business
negatively. The council amended Tuesday's action to allow vaping inside
e-cigarette shops. But the overwhelming opposition to the proposed law didn't
sway the council, which felt it was safer to err on the side of caution in
limiting the places open to vaping in public.

The ruling came after the council, led by Councilman Bob Holbrook, agreed in
March to research regulations following bans in Long Beach and Los Angeles.

Ban use of e-cigarettes in public places

BYLINE: Samuel Yesuiah

SECTION: Viewpoint; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 225 words","


WHY do people smoke, even though they waste money doing it and it is bad for
their health? Yet, about 38 per cent of men and 1.4 per cent of women in
Malaysia smoke.

Also, 20,000 Malaysians die annually from smoking-related deaths.

Every move taken by the government, including increasing the prices of
cigarettes, has not shown positive results.

There is now vaping, which is cost-effective and, supposedly, less dangerous
than normal cigarettes.

Vapers use liquids that contain nicotine, which makes it addictive. Drawing
chemical vapours into the lungs damages the lungs.

Anything that you take regularly into your body will have side effects and the
real dangers of vape smoking will manifest themselves in 10 to 20 years.

At the Liverpool versus Malaysia friendly match at Bukit Jalil National Stadium,
there were many fans who were vaping.

The smoke coming from these edevices was unbelievable. It was suffocating,
blinding and overwhelming. Yet these young boys and men were puffing away.

Though there are no conclusive studies on the dangers of vaping, the government
should consider banning vaping in public places.

Many countries have banned vaping and Malaysia should follow suit.

If God had intended man to smoke, then our nostrils would not be facing
downwards but upwards like chimneys and exhaust pipes.

Discourage teen from 'vaping'

SECTION: LIVING; Pg. B,6,999

LENGTH: 679 words","


Q.My 16-year-old daughter is vaping. Have you heard of this? How can I persuade
her it's not a good idea? -- Gretchen F., Lexington, Ky.

A. We confess, we had to do some research on this one. But after smoking out the
info, we hope we can help you persuade your teen that using electronic
cigarettes can have consequences.

For those of you who need a quick course on vaping: It's a hipster version of
smoking tobacco. Retail vaporiums sell flavored vapor cartridges -- with or
without nicotine. Placed in high-tech gadgets with names like EGO and iTaste,
the cartridges are battery-activated to produce a smokeless cloud when you
inhale.

The vaping liquids are sometimes made with propylene glycol (other bases are
used, but not all companies say what they are). While the Food and Drug
Administration says propylene glycol generally is safe in personal-care products
and plastics, animal research indicates that inhaling the chemical may affect
fertility and the health of offspring. You also can tell your daughter that one
study found five minutes of vaping lowers lung function as much as smoking a
conventional cigarette.

In its favor, this cloud of vapor doesn't contain the 60 known carcinogens found
in tobacco smoke, and it may be a way to kick tobacco (it works for some folks).
But as a general rule, putting anything besides relatively clean air into your
lungs can lead to a roster of complications, depending on what's inhaled. If
your daughter wants to feel hip, suggest nonpermanent, vegetable-based hair
color; you can live with that, and so can she, right? And for stress relief,
suggest joining an after-school athletic program or doing yoga together. She'll
learn how important it is to inhale without extra chemicals in every breath --
and appreciate how much you want to help.

Q.I'm 48 and just got a prescription for testosterone therapy because I'm tired
all the time and am having trouble with my sex life. Now I hear it may be bad
for my heart. Can I raise my testosterone levels without taking my low-T
medication? -- Steve G., Stonybrook, N.Y.

A. Although we don't know your medical history, there's a good chance you can
elevate your total and free testosterone levels and improve your sex life
without your prescription.

First, you may not have clinically significant low testosterone. More than 25
percent of low-T prescriptions handed out in the past few years were dispensed
without a blood test, which is the only way to know for sure. (When you get a
blood test, your free testosterone level is what's in your bloodstream and is
the important number, but many labs report only total T.)

Even if you had a blood test, minor illnesses, lack of recent exercise, the time
of day, stress or even your favorite team losing a game can cause a temporary
drop in free testosterone. So get another (or your first) blood test. If your
free testosterone level is below 200 nanograms per deciliter, that qualifies as
a deficiency. (Below 300? Repeat the test.)

Also, high blood pressure, elevated LDL cholesterol, diabetes or obesity can
cause low-T levels. Improve those conditions by eliminating the Five Food Felons
and eating nine servings of produce daily, plus increasing physical activity
(aim for 10,000 steps a day). That will give every aspect of your life a boost,
including your sex life.

Using do-it-yourself T-boosters also helps you dodge potential health risks from
testosterone supplements. A new study shows low-T therapy doubles the risk of
heart attack for men over 65 and almost triples the risk for those younger, if
they have a history of heart disease.

So, to recap: The smart steps to increase your T level and improve your sex life
include improving your diet and increasing physical activity, plus limiting
alcoholic drinks to two a day, reducing stress using meditation, stopping
smoking if you smoke and increasing cuddle time with your honey.

Dr. Mehmet Oz is host of ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief
wellness officer and chairman of the Wellness Institute at Cleveland Clinic.

Vaping is fast becoming an alternative to smoking, but is it safe?

That is a question the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority is
seeking to answer during a consultation.

In fact, the NHS in Devon is currently offering no advice on electronic
cigarettes until the outcome of the consultation is known.



The unregulated product, sold only to over-18s by responsible retailers,
contains no tobacco and is not lit, meaning it can be used by nicotine addicts
to outsmart the smoking ban in pubs, clubs and offices - while maintaining their
addiction.

The practice is commonly known as vaping, as opposed to smoking, because the
user inhales a vapour, not smoke, which can be exhaled.

The vapour is said to be harmless.

Although vaping is recognised as an alternative to smoking and not a definitive
aid to quitting, the e-cigarette could end up being banned in the UK.

There are fears traders could be forced to apply for licences to sell the
product as a medical device.

This has come as a shock to advocates of vaping, who point out there is no
cancer-causing agent in the device, no risk of passive smoking and no odour.

In fact, they wonder why the NHS is not actively promoting the product to
hardened nicotine addicts who have no desire, or willpower, to kick the habit.

The truth is, experts say the dangers, or benefits, of using the device are not
yet fully known.

However, they admit the vast majority of chemicals found in cigarettes, up to
5,000, are eliminated in the electronic product.

Scientific trials by Government agencies are a work in progress.

East Devon District Council, which is offering no advice on the product to
businesses, told the Midweek Herald that it is aware that Trading Standards
officers in the UK have raised concerns about some of the electronic cigarettes
it has come across.

A spokesman said: ""We understand that Trading Standards officers have previously
found that some so-called e-cigarettes sold in the UK are in contravention of
product safety regulations.

""Despite the obvious elimination of harmful carcinogens from tobacco smoke, our
view is that the overall position concerning health benefits is still unclear
and, currently, we do not promote their use, nor do we advise businesses about
them.

""Interested parties may wish to visit  http://ash.org.uk/ to get a broader view
on smoking cessation and health.""

Devon Trading Standards had nothing to say on the subject when The Herald asked
for guidance.

While the health effects of electronic cigarettes are not fully known,
authorities in New York could become the first to ban their use.

Blending boutique comes to Altrincham

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 216 words","


VAPING brand VIP officially launched its new 'blending boutique' recently,
giving Altrincham customers the chance to design their own vaping e-liquid
flavours.

Located on George Street in the centre of Altrincham's shopping precinct, the
store allows current smokers and e-cigarette users the chance to try the latest
technology in vaping, while offering them the opportunity to blend their own
flavours with the help of expert 'mixologists'.

As part of the official launch on September 26, customers were invited to enjoy
Champagne and nibbles to celebrate the new store.

Louise Stamper, commercial director at VIP Electronic Cigarettes, said: ""We're
really excited to be bringing the blending boutique experience to Altrincham -
and in such a great location. We're delighted to be helping the increasing
number of people that are switching to vaping to explore the different options
and flavours available to them.

""VIP is passionate about setting a standard in the market, and our blending
boutiques have the features to ensure that users enjoy a premium vaping
experience. We're looking forward to welcoming Altrincham's shoppers through our
doors.""

VIP has invested £300,000 in the blending boutique - the fifth of its kind -
creating four new jobs.

The store is the company's 140th shop in the UK.

NEWS FEATURE: A new addiction By News Desk in Kuala Lumpur/The Star/28 June 2015

LENGTH: 578  words","


Kuala Lumpur (The Star/ANN) - Unregulated, vaping will create a population of
nicotine and drug addicts among non-smokers, warns Universiti Malaya associate
professor Dr Amer Siddiq Amer Nordin.
Self-regulation alone is not enough because there are ¿rogues¿ in the industry,
he says.
Previously, nicotine was only introduced through tobacco use. Now, a new breed
of nicotine addicts who have never smoked are emerging, he says.
Nicotine in youngsters are especially dangerous because it affects the brain, he
says, adding that a growing number of college students are selling vape kits to
their juniors for side income.
¿Don¿t be naive. Vape mimics smoke. How do parents explain the difference to
impressionable youths?""
The juices - mostly containing nicotine - and advertisements, are enticing to
teens, he says. He notes that more young women have also started vaping.
Dr Amer Siddiq, who is also a consultant psychiatrist and nicotine addiction
specialist, is planning to research the vaping phenomenon here.
Questioning the legality of selling nicotine juices, he says the lack of labels
and proper lab testing are also worrying.
We know how each agent inside the juices work but when mixed together, is the
chemical reaction safe, he asks.
¿Even the devices don¿t have to meet Sirim standards and can be misused to vape
drugs,"" he cautions.
He says that in the United States, a new designer drug called Flakka is often
smoked using e-cigs.
A technical working group to study the impact of e-cigarettes on smokers and
those surrounding them has been formed, Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor
Hisham Abdullah says.
The group¿s upcoming report, which includes e-cigs as an alternative to reduce
smoking, will be used to create a new policy on vaping activities in the
country, he says.
This emerging trend seems to be popular among adult smokers attempting to cut
back on cigarettes, he says, adding that many studies have shown that the
popularity of e-cigarettes is increasing among smokers as an alternative to
tobacco.
""(However) the vaping trend or e-cigarette smoking among underage Malaysians is
something we should be worried about as youngsters by nature are more likely to
experiment with new things.""
Once ready, the detailed report will be discussed by the World Health
Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control steering committee chaired
by Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam, he says.
National Institute of Respiratory Medicine director Datuk Dr Abdul Razak
Muttalif assures that the report will be ready soon.  ¿We need some time as the
industry is still in its early stages,"" he says.
He, however, warns parents that there¿s a risk of their children being addicted
to nicotine if they are vaping.
¿There are pros and cons to vaping. It helps wean smokers off cigarettes but the
long-term effects of the vapour is still unknown,"" he says.
He says the main concern is the content of the vaping liquid because we don¿t
know what kind of ¿funny concoctions¿ people are coming up with, adding that the
devices and liquids must be regulated.
¿As the liquid contains nicotine, it¿ll be under the ministry¿s pharmaceutical
department.""
In the United Kingdom, ENDS will be licensed as a medicine from next year to
ensure that ¿standards of quality, safety and efficacy are met; monitoring
safety in use, including over the long-term, is provided for; and advertising is
controlled through medicines provisions and any emerging risks.""

KL considers banning e-cigarettes;
Health Ministry concerned about growing trend of vaping, especially among the
young

SECTION: WORLD

LENGTH: 384 words","


MALACCA · There are some 1,000 shops and outlets serving Malaysia's growing
group of vapers, or users of electronic cigarette vaporisers, with more than 400
local brands and nicotine-infused liquids.

Users claim vaping helps them to quit smoking actual cigarettes, but the
Malaysian Health Ministry said they often end up doing both.

Health Minister S. Subramaniam is now working to have vaping banned in Malaysia,
or at least stringently regulated. E-cigarettes are banned in Singapore.

Datuk Seri Subramaniam said the ministry is studying the models used in
countries that have banned it and those which had imposed strict rules, to adopt
the best practices for legislation.

""We have not made a definite decision yet. The options we are considering range
from very strict regulation to a total ban. We are looking at existing laws
under the ministry and the laws of other ministries on the best approach to
take,"" he said.

The ministry has been concerned about the growing trend of vaping among
Malaysians, especially those below 18. With more than a million vapers, it has
grown to be a RM500 million (S$162.7 million) industry. Malaysia has the biggest
number of users in Asia and, worldwide, is second only to the United States,
officials have said.

""We are now working out a few legal premises. We will choose the most
appropriate Act that will give us the power to do it,"" he said. ""If it were up
to me, I will ban it as soon as possible. I feel we have to put a stop to this
before it becomes a big issue.""

Dr Subramaniam said the ministry was compiling results of studies on the health
risks of vaping and its effects on passive vapers and other information.

He said regulations could also include barring the use of vapers in restaurants
and other public areas.

A vaper and the co-owner of Vape Street, Mr Yazuan Yatim, said he sells RM2,000
(S$650) a day of various vape flavours and e-cigarettes since opening two months
ago.

""My customers are mostly working adults and most are trying to stop smoking.
They buy a few bottles and they can last them for a month,"" he said.

Said vaper Nancy Nais, 33, a corporate manager: ""If they want to ban vaping
because it is harmful, they should also ban cigarettes. They might as well
legalise vaping and tax customers,"" she said.

Fog of doubt still shrouds e-cigarettes;
Health advocates express concerns over safety of `vaping' chemicals

BYLINE: Lori Kersey, Staff writer

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg. P1D

LENGTH: 860 words","


Electronic cigarettes are sometimes billed as a safer alternative to smoking
tobacco, but there is still a lot that medical professionals don't know about ""
vaping.""

""A lot of the products are so new that the research is still being done, said
Chantal Fields, area director of the American Lung Association of West Virginia.
But some of what is known about e-cigarettes is of concern, she said.

One study, by the health watchdog group the Center for Environmental Health,
found that 97 e-cigarettes and vaping products had high levels of formaldehyde
and acetalehyde, which are cancer-causing chemicals. Vape ""e-juice"" (the liquid
that is poured into the e-cigarettes for users to inhale) also has high
concentrations of nicotine. The juice can poison a child who drinks it and burn
the skin it comes in contact with, Fields said.

E-juice often comes in colorful bottles and is often candy-flavored.

""We are seeing kids poisoning themselves because it looks like candy and it's
not, Fields said. There's no research that shows e-cigarettes are safer than
traditional tobacco products, Fields said.

A chemical found in some electronic cigarettes, diacetyl, has been linked to
debilitating lung disease. Diacetyl is used in butter flavoring.

Citing a 2002 report from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health, The Washington Post reported eight workers in a microwave popcorn plant
in Missouri developed bronchiolitis obliterans - known as ""popcorn lung - after
they breathed diacetyl on the job. Four of the workers needed lung transplants
and five died of respiratory causes, according to The Washington Post.

Vaping advocates say the jury is still out on whether diacetyl and a similar
chemical, acetyl propionyl, are dangerous to e-cigarette users.

""Those cases in which diacetyl was seen directly to cause broncholitis
obliterans were cases in which workers were exposed to an actual vapor from
heated flavorings, Oliver Kershaw, founder of the E-Cigarette Forum, wrote in a
blog dated July 3, 2015, on vaping.com. ""Despite the name, vaping itself is
actually not, in the main, the inhalation of a vapor, but of an aerosol. In an
aerosol, the particles from the gaseous phase have condensed into larger
droplets.

""It's unclear whether these droplets are capable of depositing DA/AP deep within
the lung, he wrote.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more and more
teenagers are picking up e-cigarettes. Vaping among middle and high schoolers
tripled from 2013 to 2014, according to CDC data released in August. Findings
from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco survey show that among high school
students, current e-cigarette use (defined as on at least one day in the past 30
days) went from 4.5 percent to 13.4 percent in 2014. Among middle schoolers, the
numbers went from 1.1 percent in 2013 to 3.9 percent in 2014.

""We want parents to know that nicotine is dangerous for kids at any age, whether
it's an e-cigarette, hookah, cigarette or cigar, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden
said in a statement. ""Adolescence is a critical time for brain development.
Nicotine exposure at a young age may cause lasting harm to brain development,
promote addiction and lead to sustained tobacco use.

The American Lung Association's official position on e-cigarettes is that the
organization is ""very concerned about the potential health consequences of
vaping and about the unproven claim that they can be used to help a person stop
smoking, according to an ALA statement last year.

Similarly, the American Heart Association has also encouraged caution about
vaping.

""E-cigarettes are dangerous because they target young people, can keep people
hooked on nicotine, and threaten to re-normalize tobacco use, the AHA said in a
statement on its website. ""Analysis of the limited data suggested that
e-cigarettes did appear to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes and - as
a last resort - may help people quit smoking.

""But those finds were accompanied with warnings that the observations were based
on a limited pool of medical research and there were no long-term results, the
statement said.

The Food and Drug Administration does not currently regulate e-cigarettes.

""There is little or no regulation of this product because it's not a traditional
tobacco product - it doesn't fit the current FDA definition of the cigarette,
therefore it's not regulated federally, Fields said. ""Any regulation is left up
to states.

In West Virginia, people have to be 18 before they can purchase e-cigarettes.

""It's a regulation not every state has, Fields said.

While electronic cigarettes have been touted by some as a better alternative to
smoking tobacco, their high concentrations of nicotine and the toxic effects of
the chemicals that comprise the vapor that users inhale have led health
officials and advocates to question just how safe the devices are.

Leonardo DiCaprio faces vape-free Oscars;
Academy will ban e-cigarettes at prize ceremony, say reports, after American
Lung Association criticised star of The Revenant for vaping in public

Leonardo DiCaprio was scolded by the American Lung Association after he was seen
vaping at the Screen Actors Guild awards last weekend. Now he may need to find
another way to wait for the announcement of the Academy's best actor prize,
after reports that e-cigarettes will not be tolerated at this year's Oscars.

TMZ says the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is enforcing a strict
no-smoking zone inside the Dolby theatre, Los Angeles, which will include vaping
. Those who wish to smoke will be asked to do so in dedicated areas next to the
venue.

""As we previously reported, the American Lung Association ripped Leo for vaping
inside the SAG Awards last week,"" states TMZ. ""If he does the same on Oscar
night - we're told it WILL be a problem.""

The American Lung Association said on Monday it was ""deeply troubled"" by the
sight of DiCaprio vaping in public, largely because it could affect the health
of those around him. ""Without Food and Drug Administration regulation and
review, we simply don't know what is in e-cigarettes,"" the association said in a
statement. ""However, in initial lab tests conducted in 2009, the FDA found
detectable levels of toxic, cancer-causing chemicals - including an ingredient
used in antifreeze... There is no evidence that shows e-cigarettes emissions
(secondhand aerosol) are safe for non-users to inhale.""

DiCaprio is runaway favourite to take the best actor prize for his turn as a
vengeful 19th-century trapper in Alejandro González Iñárritu's western The
Revenant at the Oscars ceremony on 28 February.

                        Daily Camera (Boulder, Colorado)

Boulder approves expanded outdoor smoking ban, including e-cigarettes

BYLINE: Erica Meltzer Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 658 words","


Boulder smokers will no longer be able to light up in the downtown business
district, in city parks, open space or within 25 feet of bus stops, multi-use
paths and entrances to buildings.


The Boulder City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to adopt the outdoor
smoking ban, the latest in a series of bans that started with a prohibition on
smoking on the Pearl Street Mall in 2012.

 Last year, the city banned smoking in the Civic Area and near Boulder High
School through city manager's rules.



 The broad outdoor smoking ban applies to electronic cigarettes as well as
conventional cigarettes, and that issue was the sole source of disagreement
among the people who spoke at a public hearing on the ordinance.

 Kevan Masters told the City Council he smoked for 22 years and finally was able
to quit by switching to vaping.

 ""Electronic cigarettes"" usually contain a battery-operated heating element that
vaporizes a solution containing nicotine. That vapor is then inhaled by the
user. Unless the solution is flavored -- which it often is -- there is no odor.

 Advocates of vaping say it is much safer than smoking cigarettes and provides
an alternative for people who have been unable to quit in other ways.

 They told the City Council banning vaping in public sends a message to smokers
that they should just keep smoking cigarettes because there is no difference and
that there is no equivalent to second-hand smoke that would harm passersby.

 But Boulder County Public Health Director Jeff Zayach said studies have shown
some of the by-products of vaping may be harmful, and it keeps people addicted
to nicotine. Allowing vaping in public also normalizes nicotine use and sends
the wrong message to children, he said.

 In making the motion to include electronic cigarettes in the ban, Councilman
Tim Plass said he would rather err on the side of caution.

 ""I still have serious concerns about e-cigarettes,"" he said. ""They are not
regulated, and nicotine is still harmful. And people might not know they are
around them.""

 Councilman Macon Cowles agreed.

 ""I'm not buying the argument that we should let vaping go forward because it is
less damaging than smoking,"" he said. ""The jury is still out, but I'm old enough
to remember when the industry pushing smoking had doctors endorsing nicotine. I
don't want to send the message to young people that it's OK to consume tobacco
in this way.""

 Councilman George Karakehian, who lost his father to lung cancer, said he would
support the ban, but he thought including e-cigarettes was a mistake.

 ""It doesn't bother me if someone vapes near me because I believe the effect on
me is minimal,"" he said. ""I think when the studies do come in, we should be open
to changing this and have it be available to people. I believe if my dad vaped
his whole life, he'd be addicted to nicotine but alive.""

 Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum said it was remarkable that no one came forward to
oppose the smoking ban on cigarettes.

 ""It's interesting that extending this to parks and open space is fairly
non-controversial,"" he said. ""That's a really significant thing. Places that
people might want to linger, parks and open space, are now free of second-hand
smoke.""

 The ban will apply within the boundaries of the downtown business district,
which extends several blocks around the Pearl Street Mall, including alleys
within the district, all city parks and open space, Chautauqua, Flatirons Golf
Course, multi-use paths, within 25 feet of those paths, and within 25 feet of
bus stops and building entrances.

 City officials said enforcement would start with warnings and signage. Police
likely won't start writing tickets until May.

VIEW: Huffing and puffing over vape By M. Veera Pandiyan in Kuala Lumpur/The
Star/18 November 2015

LENGTH: 1009  words","


Kuala Lumpur (The Star/ANN) - Exactly 37 years ago today, the suicides of cult
leader Jim Jones and more than 900 of his followers in Guyana, South America,
made the news around the world.
I remember Nov 18, 1978, like it was yesterday, but for another significant
reason.


At about 6pm on that day, I exhaled my last puff and crushed the half-smoked
cigarette under my shoe.
Over the next few days, it was sheer hell dealing with nicotine withdrawal. I
had started the habit at the age of 15 and over the next eight years, progressed
to two packs a day.
Previous attempts to quit were short-lived because like most smokers, I was
hooked on both sides of nicotine addiction - physical craving and psychological
dependence.
The psychological part was the tougher nut to crack but if there is real resolve
to stop, it can be done.
If one has been psyched into believing that smoking is cool before being
addicted, one can be psyched out of it too.
As it was the hardest thing that I had ever done, I picked up another bad habit
- bragging about it, albeit only for a while.
Today, the first option for those trying to quit is to vape instead.
Malaysia has emerged as one of the countries where the use of electronic vapour
devices or e-cigarettes have skyrocketed.
These battery-powered gadgets heat up liquid solutions called ¿juices¿ which
contain, in most cases, nicotine along with glycerin, propylene glycol and food
or drink flavours.
When the juice is heated, it turns into a vapour which is inhaled.
The Health Ministry¿s plan to either ban or strictly regulate vaping caught the
booming local industry by surprise.
Raids on vaping outlets and seizures of devices and juices further roiled
players in the 500 million ringgit (US$114.37 million) business, reputedly the
second biggest in the world, after the United States.
The industry feels that the Poisons Act 1952 (Revised 1989), which the ministry
used to act, is obsolete. Traders are also arguing that it is unfair for vape
liquids to remain under the Act when nicotine in cigarettes is allowed under the
Food Act, 1983.
Ministry secretary-general Noor Hisham Abdullah, who announced the forming of a
special task force on vape outlets last week, said liquids with nicotine must be
registered under the Control of Drugs and Cosmetics Regulation 1954 and the Sale
of Drugs Act 1952, and distributed only through pharmacists and doctors.
As always in Malaysia, the elements of racism and political posturing are also
clouding the issue.  On Monday, Mohd Riduan Abdullah, the head of the
non-governmental organisation Pertubuhan Ikatan Usahawan Kecil dan Sederhana
Malaysia (Ikhlas), urged Minister Health Dr S. Subramaniam to rescind the
decision.
He also asked whether the minister would crack down on vaping if the majority of
those in the industry were Indians instead of Malays.
Rural and Regional Development Minister Ismail Sabri, who is against any ban on
vaping, weighed in by saying that the Malay-dominated industry would die if only
pharmacists and doctors were allowed to sell nicotine-laced vapes.
Earlier, Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said on Twitter that he
preferred stringent rules for both vaping and tobacco, adding that if vaping was
banned, cigarettes should be too.
Indeed, that would be the ideal solution but it is not a practical one.
Cigarettes in their present form have been around for about 150 years.
During the 1930s and 1940s, tobacco firms in the US even used doctors to promote
their smokes. One ad read: ¿More doctors smoke Camels than any other brand.¿
It was only during the 1970s that the dangers of smoking were highlighted
globally, and regulations and controls were only imposed in the early 1980s.
A World Health Organisation-led treaty to achieve a tobacco-free world by 2030,
which came into force 10 years ago, has resulted in a drop of tobacco use but
smoking still kills about six million people globally each year.
With teenagers and young adults caught up in the cool vaping craze, e-cigarettes
are understandably the bigger worry.
On the surface, they appear to be safer than regular fags.
Three months ago, Public Health England, an independent executive agency of
Britain¿s Department of Health, reported that e-cigarettes are 95 per cent less
harmful than smoking.
The agency, however, quickly came under fire from public health directors for
basing its views on research funded by organisations with links to the tobacco
industry.
With multinational tobacco manufacturers among the main players in the
e-cigarettes industry, the authorities are worried that smoking could be back in
vogue if vaping becomes acceptable.
It has been reported that about one-third of existing studies are biased with
researchers declaring conflicts of interest.
Most medical experts, including those in Malaysia, however agree that vaping is
a good option for smokers who want to quit. It is an acceptable harm-reduction
tool in the short term.
But beyond that, in spite of the many studies, everything is as misty as the
exhaled plumes of vapers. The long-term impact of vaping is still anybody¿s
guess.
There are now hundreds of e-cigarette brands and thousands of flavours,
including Malaysia¿s highly popular homegrown juices.
The devices deliver different amounts of nicotine, flavours and other additives.

In the US and several other countries, vapers also mix drugs like
methamphetamine and marijuana in the juices.
A senior Health Ministry official said there were just too many unknown things
about vaping and the safest thing to do was to take a no-risk approach.
¿As it is, enforcement will be an nightmare. Just like what most countries are
trying to do, we need to impose clear and stringent rules,¿ he said.
Banning vaping may be difficult but there must be firm and fair controls on
juices, limits on nicotine strengths and strict checks on advertising to reduce
the still unknown risks.
(The writer likes this observation by Roman historian Tacitus: Truth is
confirmed by inspection and delay, falsehood by haste and uncertainty.)

KiK E-Cigarettes will air its first vaping advertisement on national TV on the
day the new advertising rules for e-cigarettes come into force.

The new rules, revealed by the committee of advertising practice (CAP) last
month commence today.

TV advertising for cigarettes was banned in 1965 and in 1986 all advertising
showing people smoking was also banned.

In a TV landmark, KiK will be the first in the industry to show people vaping,
an action that has never been seen before on a TV commercial.

The advert will be on air until December 10 on channels including ITV, Channel 4
and Dave.

KiK chief executive Sandy Chadha said: ""The new advertising rules are a positive
step to show people how vaping can help them move away from tobacco products and
we are delighted to make history on November 10.

""Vaping is a new way of life for past smokers and the advert highlights friends
talking about the impact making the change has had for them.

""We hope it is well received and gives smokers some food for thought.""

KiK said sales have increased by 163 per cent since February 2014.

KiK E-Cigarettes will air its first vaping advertisement on national TV on the
day the new advertising rules for e-cigarettes come into force.

The new rules, revealed by the committee of advertising practice (CAP) last
month commence today.

TV advertising for cigarettes was banned in 1965 and in 1986 all advertising
showing people smoking was also banned.

In a TV landmark, KiK will be the first in the industry to show people vaping,
an action that has never been seen before on a TV commercial.

The advert will be on air until December 10 on channels including ITV, Channel 4
and Dave.

KiK chief executive Sandy Chadha said: ""The new advertising rules are a positive
step to show people how vaping can help them move away from tobacco products and
we are delighted to make history on November 10.

""Vaping is a new way of life for past smokers and the advert highlights friends
talking about the impact making the change has had for them.

""We hope it is well received and gives smokers some food for thought.""

KiK said sales have increased by 163 per cent since February 2014.

There is no evidence that the use of e-cigarettes is harmless

BYLINE: NO BYLINE

SECTION: HS - FEATURES; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 433 words","


COLETTE Douglas Home  urges us not to be too harsh on the users of e-cigarettes
and she is correct; we need to do everything we can to support those trapped in
their addiction to tobacco, and its primary drug, nicotine (""We shouldn't be too
harsh on the users of e-cigarettes"", The Herald, May 6).

Ms Douglas Home worries that we might be excluding people from their friends if
we ban them from vaping e-cigarettes in restaurants, cafes, pubs and other
public places. They are, after all, responsible tobacco addicts who are trying
to overcome their addiction by using e-cigarettes as an aid to quit smoking.

What she has missed in her well-researched article are the myths that already
surround the new smoking trend, vaping.

The first myth is that vaping helps people to stop smoking tobacco in the
standard form of cigarettes. No evidence is yet available to support this
theory. Another is that vaping ""is safer than standard cigarettes"". Again there
is no evidence for this, but much that confirms that nicotine is highly
addictive, and so must be bad for our health regardless of the method of
allowing it to enter our bodies. I wonder if she would support injecting
nicotine into our veins as being an even safer way to get nicotine into our
bloodstream, rather than vaping it through expensive cigarette-style holders?

Ms Douglas Home also did not seem to think it was all that significant that
e-cigarettes have come on to the market with no legal restriction.  There is no
control of quality, or strength of the nicotine, no restriction on who can sell
it nor who can buy it.

The scandal that she did not reveal is that the multi-billion dollar tobacco
industry has hoodwinked governments into allowing this myth-ridden product on to
the market without questioning why it is there.  They have all bought the bogus
argument that it might help the reluctant residue of older smokers to quit, when
there is no science to back that.

There is, though, already evidence that those who start off vaping occasionally
soon return to the old smokers' habit of upping the dose. This is why the
tobacco industry is laughing all the way to the bank.

The Scottish Government's response is to wait until at least 2016 when it is
hoped that European legislation might come into force to restrict the age of
those who can purchase and use the raw nicotine contained in e-cigarettes. In
the meantime the market for this bogus aid to quitting smoking will grow, and a
new generation of nicotine addicts will be created who will then need help to
quit their addiction.

Vaping may pose health risks for teen

BYLINE: Heather Warlick

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 707 words","


Q: My 16-year-old daughter is vaping. Have you heard of this? How can I persuade
her it's not a good idea?- Gretchen F.,Lexington, Ky.A: We confess, we had to do
some research on this one!

But after smoking out the info, we hope we can help you persuade your teen that
using electronic cigarettes can have consequences.For those of you who need a
quick course on vaping: It's a hipster version of smoking tobacco. Retail
vaporiums sell flavored vapor cartridges - with or without nicotine. Placed in
high-tech gadgets with names like EGO and iTaste, the cartridges are
battery-activated to produce a smokeless cloud when you inhale.The vaping
liquids are sometimes made with propylene glycol (other bases are used, but not
all companies say what they are). While the Food and Drug Administration says
propylene glycol generally is safe in personal-care products and plastics,
animal research indicates that inhaling the chemical may affect fertility and
the health of offspring. You also can tell your daughter that one study found
five minutes of vaping lowers lung function as much as smoking a conventional
cigarette.In its favor, this cloud of vapor doesn't contain the 60 known
carcinogens found in tobacco smoke, and it may be a way to kick tobacco (it
works for some folks). But as a general rule, putting anything besides
relatively clean air into your lungs can lead to a roster of complications,
depending on what's inhaled. If your daughter wants to feel hip, suggest
nonpermanent, vegetable-based hair color (try red! blue!). You can live with
that, and so can she, right? And for stress relief, suggest joining an
after-school athletic program or doing yoga together. She'll learn how important
it is to inhale without extra chemicals in every breath - and appreciate how
much you want to help.Q: I'm 48 and just got a prescription for testosterone
therapy because I'm tired all the time and am having trouble with my sex life.
Now I hear it may be bad for my heart. Can I raise my testosterone levels
without taking my low-T medication?- Steve G.,Stonybrook, N.Y.A: Although we
don't know your medical history, there's a good chance you can elevate your
total and free testosterone levels and improve your sex life without your
prescription.First, you may not have clinically significant low
testosterone.More than 25 percent of low-T prescriptions handed out in the past
few years were dispensed without a blood test, which is the only way to know for
sure. (When you get a blood test, your free testosterone level is what's in your
bloodstream and is the important number, but many labs report only total T.)Even
if you had a blood test, minor illnesses, lack of recent exercise, the time of
day, stress or even your favorite team losing a game can cause a temporary drop
in free testosterone.So get another (or your first) blood test. If your free
testosterone level is below 200 nanograms per deciliter, that qualifies as a
deficiency. (Below 300? Repeat the test.)Also, high blood pressure, elevated LDL
cholesterol, diabetes or obesity can cause low-T levels.Improve those conditions
by eliminating the ""five food felons"" (trans fat, saturated fat, added sugar,
syrups and any grain but whole grain) and eating nine servings of produce daily,
plus increasing physical activity (aim for 10,000 steps a day).That will give
every aspect of your life a boost, including your sex life.Using do-it-yourself
T-boosters also helps you dodge potential health risks from testosterone
supplements. A new study shows low-T therapy doubles the risk of heart attack
for men older than 65 and almost triples the risk for those younger, if they
have a history of heart disease.So, to recap: The smart steps to increase your T
level and improve your sex life include improving your diet and increasing
physical activity, plus limiting alcoholic drinks to two a day, reducing stress
using meditation, stopping smoking if you smoke and increasing cuddle time with
your honey.Mehmet Oz, M.D., is host of ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" and Mike Roizen, M.D.,

Malaysia won¿t ban growing trend but health authorities concerned By Mazwin Nik
Anis in Putrajaya/The Star/01 November 2015

LENGTH: 282  words","


Putrajaya (The Star/ANN) - Vapers can breathe a sigh of relief. The Malaysian
government has no plans to ban vaping for now.


The Cabinet made the decision after a lengthy discussion on the matter during
its weekly meeting on Friday (October 30).
However, health authorities intend to educate the public on the growing trend as
they look for evidence of any harmful effects from inhaling flavoured vapour.
Health minister Dr S. Subramaniam expressed his ¿deep concern over the steep
increase in the number of people vaping in Malaysia¿ during the meeting.
¿I am worried about the possible long-term consequences of inhaling vapours that
may contain nicotine, formaldehyde and propylene glycol,"" he said.
The Cabinet also discussed the differences between smoking and vaping.
Dr Subramaniam said it saw the need for public education on the possible health
effects and that vaping should be regulated, both of which the Health Ministry
has been tasked with.
¿The success of these efforts and the advent of any further evidence will decide
whether we need to ban it,"" he said.
The decision not to ban vaping drew praise from Rural and Regional Development
Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.
¿Thank you, Prime Minister and the Government, for understanding the aspirations
of the young,"" he wrote in a Facebook posting.
Talk of a ban followed the ministry¿s concern over the trend among Malaysians,
especially those below 18.
There are more than a million vapers in Malaysia, making it a half-billion
ringgit industry.
Also, the country has the most vapers in Asia and is second only to the United
States in the world. Singapore and several other countries have banned
e-cigarettes, a type of vaping device.

E-cigarettes Ignite New Enterprise Opportunities In R.i.

To Rebecca Boff, electronic cigarettes are a life-saver.

Boff, 40, a former Rhode Island state social worker, is the proprietor of Ocean
State Vapes, at 219 Putnam Pike, Johnston. She sells e-cigarettes and supplies
and welcomes their users to grab a seat and ""vape"" in her store.

Puffing on an e-cigarette - or vaping - is meant to be a way to quit smoking
tobacco and to reduce or eliminate the inhalation of nicotine and other harmful
particles and substances in tobacco.

And Boff is a believer.

She suffered from bleeding ulcers that were aggravated by her habitual smoking,
and one day, she recalled, ""I almost bled out in my house.""

Desperate, she turned to vaping, and after 11/2 years, managed to quit smoking.

""I smoked for 25 years,"" she recalled. ""Vaping literally saved my life. I was so
addicted, I would have kept smoking.""

An e-cigarette, generally speaking, is a handheld battery-powered nicotine
delivery system. It heats a liquid and turns it into a colorless, odorless vapor
without combustion.

Vaping is the inhalation of the vaporized liquid. The cloud produced is water
vapor, which advocates contend is relatively innocuous compared with the
contents of tobacco smoke.

Boff is in the vanguard of the e-cigarette boom, which is now an estimated
$3-billion-a-year industry that has become a business and cultural phenomenon a
half century after the U.S. surgeon general made history when he reported that
smoking tobacco causes illness and death and he recommended that the government
do something about it.

The Oxford Dictionaries in 2014 pronounced ""vape"" its word of the year.

An example of the phenomenon was the grand opening on a recent Saturday of
VAPEsolutely!, an e-cigarette store at 1310 Ten Rod Rd., in the Super Stop &
Shop plaza, North Kingstown.

Ocean State Vapes and VAPEsolutely! are among a number of vaping shops -
vaporiums, if you will - that have popped up around the state. They include,
among others, Sunshine Vape in Warwick, Vaporetti in Pawtucket, E-Cig Shed in
Barrington and The Vapor Lounge in downtown Providence.

""We're not going to call this healthy,"" VAPEsolutely! owner Bill Pizzuti said of
vaping. ""It's healthier than smoking.""

Vaporiums have joined hookah bars and a medical marijuana smoking lounge in
downtown Providence as the newest venues for alternatives to traditional
American smoking. Smoking tobacco in cigars, pipes and cigarettes is forbidden
in Rhode Island bars and restaurants except in recognized smoking lounges.

""It's a very controversial industry right now,"" Pizzuti said of e-cigarettes.
The industry has fought tobacco companies on the one hand and anti-tobacco
activists on the other. Many anti-tobacco activists lump vaping in with tobacco
smoking as a harmful practice.

The news has been mixed of late. In December, the American Heart Association
declared vaping to be an effective way to quit smoking. The concept is that a
smoker can taper off by vaping liquid containing progressively less and less
nicotine.

Fear of fire from lithium ion batteries in e-cigarettes, however, prompted the
Federal Aviation Administration last week to warn commercial airlines about the
risk of e-cigarette users packing their ""vapes"" in luggage destined for the
cargo hold. The FAA recommended passengers carry them aboard.

And a study described in a letter published in the New England Journal of
Medicine concluded that the vapor can contain a worrisome amount of formaldehyde
- a known carcinogen.

National Public Radio reported that the e-cigarette industry association
immediately dismissed the findings, saying that the measurements were made under
unrealistic conditions.

Pizzuti, 44, of Exeter, is a former national sales manager for the manufacturer
Astro-Med, who encountered e-cigarettes in the course of business. Eager to find
an entrepreneurial and personal way to do something positive in his home area,
he hit on e-cigarette sales.

His sleek and contemporary shop features dozens of e-hardware items and a
lengthy bar that displays more than 100 different American-made vape liquids,
also known as e-juice. A vaping aficionado can customize the liquid to be
vaporized, by flavor and amount of nicotine.

The same goes for the vaporizing instruments, which can take a form as varied as
a cigarette or a fancy oversized cigarette lighter with attached mouthpiece.
They sell for $25 to $150.

With the industry has grown a hobby, as some people collect vaporizers the way
men used to collect cigarette lighters, and others build their own heater
coil/wick systems with parts bought at the shop that enable them to vary the way
they vape.

Said Shawn Robbins, 35, of Cumberland, a customer of Ocean State Vapes, ""I
smoked for 18 years. I hate the smell of them now.""

""I quit cold turkey"" from a habit that had him consuming 11/2 packs daily, he
said. ""Me and all my friends are vaping now.""

E-cigs: Smoking gun or harmless vapour?

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1308 words","


NEW YORK, N.Y. - On the edge of the SoHo neighbourhood downtown, The Henley
Vaporium is an intimate hipster hangout with overstuffed chairs, exposed brick,
friendly counter help - but no booze.

Instead, the proprietors are peddling e-cigarettes, along with bottles of liquid
nicotine ready to be plucked from behind a wooden bar and turned into
flavourfulvapour for a lung hit with a kick that is intended to simulate
traditional smoking. A hint of banana nut bread e-juice lingered in the air one
recent afternoon as patrons gathered around a low table to chat and vape, or
sidled up to the inviting bar for help from a knowledgeable ""vapologist.""

Places like The Henley are a rarity, even in New York. But ""vaping,"" itself, has
had astonishing growth - in just eight years or so, the number of enthusiasts
around the world has grown from a few thousand to millions. Believed by some to
be the invention of a Chinese pharmacist, vaping now has its own YouTube gurus,
trade associations, lobbyists, online forums and vapefests for meet-ups centred
on what enthusiasts consider a safer alternative to the ""analog,"" their name for
tobacco cigarettes.

Vaping may be safer - there are differing opinions - but it isn't necessarily
cheap.

Will Hopkins, a 21-year-old dog walker in black leather jacket and skull ring,
visits Henley four or five times a week. He smoked a pack of full-strength
Marlboros a day for eight years, until he took up vaping. The same goes for his
buddy, 20-year-old photographer Will Gallagher, who has been vaping for two
years and is fond of his brass mod, a cylindrical device that's larger than a
cigarette and decorated with a tiger and Chinese lettering.

""I think both of us have poured in probably a little over a thousand"" dollars,
Gallagher said of their equipment. ""I like the exclusivity of vaping. I like to
keep changing up my stuff.""

The Wills are into rebuilding tanks and rewiring coils, scouting new e-liquid
flavours and adjusting their devices, which can cost up to $300 at Henley, to
allow for more vapour, more flavour. But the co-owners of Henley count older
smokers among their clientele as well.

E-cigarettes are usually made of metal parts combined with plastic or glass and
come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They heat the liquid nicotine solution,
creating vapour that quickly dissipates when exhaled. The vapour looks like
tobacco smoke and can feel like tobacco smoke when taken into the lungs at
varying strengths, from no nicotine up to 24 milligrams or more.

In 2006, sellers of all things vape worked primarily online or via kiosks in
shopping malls. Now there are more than 250 brands and devices that can cost
mere dollars for a case of ""cigalikes,"" which resemble the real thing, to a
gold-and-diamond unit the size of a fountain pen that was reportedly made for a
Russian oil tycoon and cost about $900,000.

Whether vaping is cheaper than a cigarette habit is up to how much is spent on
equipment and liquids and how often one vapes. A 15-millilitre bottle of liquid
at Henley can go for $12 and may be roughly the equivalent of four packs of
cigarettes, depending on the strength of both liquid and leaf cigarette, among
other factors like how many puffs a smoker takes in. Rechargeable devices
require batteries - another expense - and a starter kit for reuse that comes
with a device can run around $66.

By comparison, the cost of a 20-cigarette pack of regular cigarettes can range
from about $5 to about $15, depending on state tax and the type of location
where they're purchased.

The Food and Drug Administration has not yet stepped in to regulate e-cigs - and
their amped-up marketing - but that's likely to happen as some cities and states
have already moved to ban public use the way they do tobacco.

Critics believe e-cigs may serve as a tobacco gateway for uninitiated young
people. ""It may be smoking e-cigarettes, but it's still smoking,"" said U.S. Sen.
Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who was one of four senators to fire
off a scathing letter to NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association after a
spoof on e-cigs aired during the Golden Globes in January.

Proponents argue that vaping isn't only safe but is helping people quit smoking.
The Henley has a white ""wall of doom,"" where it lists in big black letters the
numerous tars and chemicals found in tobacco cigarettes, but absent in e-cig use
if one is careful about the liquids purchased.

""What's so beautiful about this product is we can take people from a high level
of nicotine down to zero, down to nothing, so they're just vaping basically
water and flavouring,"" said Henley co-owner Talia Eisenberg.

She scoffs at the notion that child-friendly flavours of e-liquids - Watermelon
Wave and Frozen Lime Drop, for instance - were created to lure teens. And she
rejects the idea that e-cig companies should be banned from advertising on TV,
as tobacco companies were more than 40 years ago.

While e-liquids and vaping supplies lack oversight and long-term research, they
are readily available to all ages online, and at gas stations, bodegas and many
drug stores. But Henley doesn't serve those under 18. Would it make more sense
to help people give up nicotine - an addictive substance - altogether?

""Sure, but how's that workin' for the country so far? How are they doin' with
that? We're talking in terms of serious harm reduction,"" said Eisenberg's
business partner, Peter Denholtz. His mother died of lung cancer two years ago;
he himself smoked cigarettes for 36 years, but has been vaping for four years.

Some vapers, like Hopkins and Gallagher, find fun in tinkering with the
paraphernalia. Denholtz likens them to older DIY enthusiasts who once whiled
away their time on Heathkits, those all-inclusive boxes of parts that could be
turned into TV receivers, amateur radios or stereo speakers.

""There's a whole subculture coming up. They're very into all of the different
devices. They rewire and rebuild and use different materials for drawing up the
juice. It's unbelievable what they've turned it into,"" he said.

Denholtz and others said vaping, to many, is merely a less harmful activity than
tobacco smoking that duplicates the most pleasurable aspects and offers a
communal feel like hookah use and cigar bars.

Xavier Armand, 25, has been vaping for a little more than three years and owns
an advertising and marketing firm that is helping Henley put together a ""liquid
of the month club,"" along the lines of mail-order fruit of the month.

""I always kind of knew smoking was bad for me. My mom was a smoker, but I was
never going to look into the patch or the gum or anything,"" Armand said. ""At the
end of the day, the best part about smoking is the smoke part. And that oral
fixation is kind of a big thing as well. I consider my agency the 2014 version
of 'Mad Men.' We all sit around there and instead of smoking cigarettes everyone
is smoking e-cigs.""

Much as movie stars made tobacco smoking seem glamorous in the 1930s and '40s,
celebrities have helped fuel interest in vaping.

At the Golden Globes, Leonardo DiCaprio was shown vaping away in the audience.
The actor told The Associated Press recently he vapes to ""relieve the stress of
life.""

Other celebrities have signed on as paid e-cig endorsers, including co-host of
""The View,"" Jenny McCarthy, and actor Stephen Dorff, both of whom push Blu, a
big player in e-cigs that was recently bought by Big Tobacco's Lorillard.

Dorff, who took up smoking 20 years ago, stuck to Blu's talking points in a
recent interview. He described how vaping offers him the freedom to smoke where
regular cigarettes are frowned upon.

But wouldn't his loved ones like to see him quit nicotine for good?

""Ah, probably yeah,"" laughed Dorff, ""but there's a lot of bad things in the
world, you know. The one thing that I've always enjoyed is smoking. I consider
myself a smoker.""

E-cigarettes Igniting New R.i. Enterprises

To Rebecca Boff, electronic cigarettes are a life-saver.

Boff, 40, a former Rhode Island state social worker, is the proprietor of Ocean
State Vapes, at 219 Putnam Pike, Johnston. She sells e-cigarettes and supplies
and welcomes their users to grab a seat and ""vape"" in her store.

Puffing on an e-cigarette - or vaping - is meant to be a way to quit smoking
tobacco and to reduce or eliminate the inhalation of nicotine and other harmful
particles and substances in tobacco.

And Boff is a believer.

She suffered from bleeding ulcers that were aggravated by her habitual smoking,
and one day, she recalled, ""I almost bled out in my house.""

Desperate, she turned to vaping, and after 11/2 years, managed to quit smoking.

""I smoked for 25 years,"" she recalled. ""Vaping literally saved my life. I was so
addicted, I would have kept smoking.""

An e-cigarette, generally speaking, is a handheld battery-powered nicotine
delivery system. It heats a liquid and turns it into a colorless, odorless vapor
without combustion.

Vaping is the inhalation of the vaporized liquid. The cloud produced is water
vapor, which advocates contend is relatively innocuous compared with the
contents of tobacco smoke.

Boff is in the vanguard of the e-cigarette boom, which is now an estimated
$3-billion-a-year industry that has become a business and cultural phenomenon a
half century after the U.S. surgeon general made history when he reported that
smoking tobacco causes illness and death and he recommended that the government
do something about it.

The Oxford Dictionaries in 2014 pronounced ""vape"" its word of the year.

An example of the phenomenon was the grand opening Saturday of VAPEsolutely!, an
e-cigarette store at 1310 Ten Rod Rd., in the Super Stop & Shop plaza, North
Kingstown.

Ocean State Vapes and VAPEsolutely! are among a number of vaping shops -
vaporiums, if you will - that have popped up around the state. They include,
among others, Sunshine Vape in Warwick, Vaporetti in Pawtucket, E-Cig Shed in
Barrington and The Vapor Lounge in downtown Providence.

""We're not going to call this healthy,"" VAPEsolutely! owner Bill Pizzuti said of
vaping. ""It's healthier than smoking.""

Vaporiums have joined hookah bars and a medical marijuana smoking lounge in
downtown Providence as the newest venues for alternatives to traditional
American smoking. Smoking tobacco in cigars, pipes and cigarettes is forbidden
in Rhode Island bars and restaurants except in recognized smoking lounges.

""It's a very controversial industry right now,"" Pizzuti said of e-cigarettes.
The industry has fought tobacco companies on the one hand and anti-tobacco
activists on the other. Many anti-tobacco activists lump vaping in with tobacco
smoking as a harmful practice.

The news has been mixed of late. In December, the American Heart Association
declared vaping to be an effective way to quit smoking. The concept is that a
smoker can taper off by vaping liquid containing progressively less and less
nicotine.

Fear of fire from lithium ion batteries in e-cigarettes, however, prompted the
Federal Aviation Administration last week to warn commercial airlines about the
risk of e-cigarette users packing their ""vapes"" in luggage destined for the
cargo hold. The FAA recommended passengers carry them aboard.

And a study described in a letter published in the New England Journal of
Medicine concluded that the vapor can contain a worrisome amount of formaldehyde
- a known carcinogen.

National Public Radio reported that the e-cigarette industry association
immediately dismissed the findings, saying that the measurements were made under
unrealistic conditions.

Pizzuti, 44, of Exeter, is a former national sales manager for the manufacturer
Astro-Med, who encountered e-cigarettes in the course of business. Eager to find
an entrepreneurial and personal way to do something positive in his home area,
he hit on e-cigarette sales.

His sleek and contemporary shop features dozens of e-hardware items and a
lengthy bar that displays more than 100 different American-made vape liquids,
also known as e-juice. A vaping aficionado can customize the liquid to be
vaporized, by flavor and amount of nicotine.

The same goes for the vaporizing instruments, which can take a form as varied as
a cigarette or a fancy oversized cigarette lighter with attached mouthpiece.
They sell for $25 to $150.

With the industry has grown a hobby, as some people collect vaporizers the way
men used to collect cigarette lighters, and others build their own heater
coil/wick systems with parts bought at the shop that enable them to vary the way
they vape.

Said Shawn Robbins, 35, of Cumberland, a customer of Ocean State Vapes, ""I
smoked for 18 years. I hate the smell of them now.""

""I quit cold turkey"" from a habit that had him consuming 11/2 packs daily, he
said. ""Me and all my friends are vaping now.""

E-cigarette firms fear Euro plans could bankrupt them

SECTION: AGENCY:MEDIA; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 392  words","


VAPING firm director Matt Balster fears electronic cigarette businesses could go
bust if new European Union rules are brought into force.

All vaping products and e-liquids would have to be thoroughly tested if the
rules are enforced, and producers would have to tell the authorities six months
before their products are put on the market.

The batch tests would effectively rule out ""legitimate"" home-brewed e-liquids,
and could cost firms hundreds of pounds for each flavour they produce, according
to Mr Balster, director of Vape It Easy in Space Business Centre.

He  said the new rules could force many vaping companies in Gloucestershire and
the UK out of business and the industry would never be the same again if the
rules are brought into force.

He said electronic cigarettes are ""life-saving"" and the new rules could force
many users back to smoking.

Mr Balster, pictured,  said: ""These new laws are going to run  smaller companies
out of business. Vaping as we know it would cease to exist.

""We know how to get people off smoking and the types of products they need. But
if the new law comes into force we would have to close our shop. There are
people's lives at stake.

""There are half-a-dozen vaping shops in Gloucester alone. It would mean a lot of
people going back to smoking and a lot of jobs being lost.""

The European Union is  trying to implement its Tobacco Products Directive on May
20 next year after it was adopted by the European Parliament in 2014.

But a legal challenge against Article 20 of the directive has been launched by
electronic cigarette manufacturer Totally Wicked, based in Blackburn, which says
the rules would put its industry at an unfair disadvantage.

The law would  mean the nicotine content in e-liquid would not be allowed to
exceed 20 milligrams per millilitre.

Businesses would   be banned from promoting their  vaping products in print,
radio and TV.

E-liquid would only be able to be sold in pre-filled cartridges containing up to
two millilitres, or refillable containers containing 10 millilitres or less.

The Tobacco Products Directive was voted in by the European Parliament after an
estimated 700,000 premature deaths are caused by smoking across the EU each
year.

The new rules would also ban flavoured cigarettes, and health warnings would
cover 65 per cent of the front and back of all cigarette packets.

New clean air debate: Smoke vs. vapor

BYLINE:  Frank Cerabino

SECTION: LOCAL & BUSINESS; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 578 words","


Next month, Tri-Rail will regulate smoking areas on its station platforms by
herding those who smoke either traditional cigarettes or vape electronic
cigarettes into a shared designated area on each platform.

""A number of passengers had been asking for it,"" said Tri-Rail spokesperson
Bonnie Arnold. ""So now, people who want to get away from smokers can, while
those who want to smoke will still be accommodated.""

But what about grouping those who are emitting scented water vapor with those
who are exhaling pungent cigarette smoke? Is it fair?

Should e-cigarettes be treated as equivalents to cigarettes when it comes to
regulations in public spaces?

It depends.

In April, Boca Raton passed an ordinance that treats e-cigarettes like
traditional cigarettes, banning them where cigarettes are banned. When Boca
first considered this ordinance earlier in the year, it called for up to 60 days
in jail for vapers who violated the smoking laws. But the ordinance that passed
recommended fines instead of jail time for violators.

But there's no state law that specifically regulates vaping, and a vaping-rights
group called Smoke Free Defense has been rallying its members to fight any
attempts at lumping vaping with traditional cigarettes.

The group's petition to lawmakers says, in part:

""We oppose statements or policies that treat smoke-free products or activities
as tobacco, or equate them with tobacco ... and any references whatsoever
suggesting that vapor, vaping, e-liquids, e-cigarettes or any other smoke-free
activities are tobacco products or tobacco-related in any way.""

Like smoking, vaping isn't odor-free. But it is different.

""When e-cigarettes are smoked in an open area, it's almost like a whiff of
fruit-flavored cologne, as opposed to a harsh-flavored tobacco smell that
lingers with a cigarette,"" said Ian Stefan, who works at Vapor Life in West Palm
Beach.

Stefan and other vapers say that it's understandable why nonsmokers in a public
space wouldn't want to smell other people's scented exhalations.

""There needs to be a respect for people in public places,"" said Jonathan Burke,
who owns Vapor Depot USA in West Palm Beach. ""We don't want to smell cigarette
smoke just like the nonsmokers who don't want to smell cigarette smoke.""

Burke said that many vapers are former smokers who don't enjoy being around
cigarette smoke.

""I don't want to be around cigarettes, because I dropped the habit,"" he said.
""So let's make a separate section for vapers and a separate area for smokers, so
nobody offends each other.""

Tri-Rail's Arnold said that vaping was included with traditional smoking in the
new platform regulation because both emit smells that others may not enjoy.

""I was at a performance at the Broward Center and somebody lit up an e-cigarette
behind me and I could smell it,"" she said.

So who knows? If vaping becomes more popular, maybe we'll end up with three
designated areas in outdoor public spaces: one for nonsmokers, another for
smokers and a third for vapers. All of us in our own cocoon of acceptable
outdoor air.

""I take it into consideration what it is to have a cloud of something blown into
your face,"" said Travis Root, who works at City Vapors in Palm Springs. ""
Vaping's not as bad as a cigarette, but I'm not going to argue that it's just
water vapor.

""It's like a big cloud of apples and oranges.""

El Paso City Council passes ban on e-cigarettes

Replay live Twitter updates: El Paso City Council meeting

The use of electronic cigarettes in public places across El Paso where smoking
is now banned will be prohibited starting Sept. 1, and both smoking and vaping
will be banned from all city-owned properties such as parks starting in 2015.

That comes after the City Council on Tuesday approved changes to its ordinance
regulating smoking in public and workplaces. The approved changes also will ban
smoking and vaping within 20 feet of all public entrances, except for the El
Paso International Airport, starting Sept. 1.

City Rep. Eddie Holguin voted against the changes, while city Rep. Emma Acosta
was absent. The other six representatives voted in favor of the ordinance
changes.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that heat a flavored liquid which
generally contains nicotine. The devices often look like cigarettes or pens and
release a vapor that is inhaled by the users known as vapers.

Supporters of the ordinance change argue that the e-cigarettes are unhealthy and
the secondhand vapor is unwelcomed even if the devices are healthier than
cigarettes.

""Let's set limits that protect shared public spaces,"" said Perla Retana, who has
a 10-month-old son and says she doesn't want to be exposed to smoking or vaping
at city parks or other public places. ""I worry that he'll find cigarettes or
parts of an e-cigarette and that it could be deadly. They're toxic.""

City Rep. Michiel Noe, a doctor, acknowledged that e-cigarettes are safer than
smoking, but said that doesn't mean they don't pose a danger.

""They're not known to be safe, just safer than cigarettes, which are known to be
killers,"" Noe said. ""That's not a good alternative.""

Opponents argue that the e-cigarettes have not been proven to be unhealthy and
that the ordinance infringes on their rights. Many who use the devices are
former smokers who don't want to be lumped into smoking areas alongside those
who use cigarettes.

A group of vapers presented a petition they said has 1,500 signatures opposing
the addition of vaping as part of the smoking definition.

""An electronic cigarette is a personal choice,"" said David Maldinar, 32, who
said he had been a smoker for 16 years. ""If (others) don't want to be around it,
they can leave.""

Jose Luis Molina, 33, said he's been able to better control his blood pressure
and diabetes since he started vaping two years ago after 20 years of smoking.

""It's a healthy alternative,"" Molina said. He added that his daughter, who
wouldn't get near him when he smoked, is now a lot more comfortable with his
vaping instead.

Robert Resendes, the city's director of public health, said the changes were not
intended to ban vaping altogether, but to prohibit it in public places.

""This is to protect the public from fumes, vapor and whatever chemicals are in
there,"" Resendes said.

Under the revised ordinance, e-cigarettes will be allowed in private homes, in
designated areas within the airport, and in cigarette and hookah lounges. Hotels
and motels also can allow vaping in up to 25 percent of rooms rented to guests.

Smoking and e-cigarettes will be prohibited in stores and malls, businesses,
restaurants, nightclubs, bars, libraries, museums, the zoo, movie theaters,
bowling alleys, sports arenas, schools and hospitals, among other places.

The changes allow the city manager to consider exceptions, such as at the Judson
F. Williams Convention Center during the upcoming U.S. Bowling Congress men's
Open Championships in 2015.

Southwest University Park already bans smoking and e-cigarettes, Resendes said.

Under the ordinance, violators face a $100 fine for the first offense, $200 for
the second, and up to $500 for the third and more.

The changes also will require hookah and smoke shops to have isolated venting
and air controls starting July 1, 2015.

The city's first smoking ordinance was implemented in January 2002 and prohibits
smoking in public places such as restaurants, bars, nightclubs, libraries,
schools and businesses.

E-cigarettes are not yet regulated, although the Food and Drug Administration is
considering regulating them as either tobacco or anti-smoking aids. Los Angeles
and New York, the city of Socorro and some 200 other cities nationwide have
banned e-cigarettes in public places, and numerous others across the nation are
considering similar bans.

SCIENCE ON E-CIGARETTE SAFETY FRUSTRATINGLY HAZY

BYLINE: Shawn Vestal

SECTION: A; Pg. 005

LENGTH: 808 words","


Every day, it seems, there are more of them: Vapers, huddled in doorways,
strolling the sidewalks and sometimes indoors, sipping their e-cigs and exhaling
blooms of odorless smoke.

The rapid rise of ""vaping"" - electronic cigarettes - has local health officials
concerned. Little is known about the health effects of vaping or of breathing
secondhand vapor. While some argue that they are a safer alternative to
cigarettes, and that they might help smokers quit, the devices also may work in
the reverse direction: helping ease young people into nicotine addiction.

A recent survey by the Spokane Regional Health District found that 26 percent of
Spokane high school sophomores had used an e-cigarette, some of which taste like
fruit or candy. That's far more than the percentage who had smoked a smelly,
old-fashioned one.

""Some of these youth are actually initiating on a vaping device,"" said Paige
McGowan, the district's coordinator of tobacco, electronic cigarettes and
marijuana prevention. ""That means they have never smoked and they are starting
on a vaping device.""

The health district has reached out to local school officials and families,
urging them to be vigilant in preventing the use of the devices among minors.
Now it is considering a broader, more aggressive approach among adults:
regulating vaping  under public smoking laws. That would mean no vaping indoors
or near doorways.

If such regulations were adopted, ""you couldn't use a vaping device anyplace you
can't use combustible tobacco,""  McGowan said.

Health officials plan to gather public feedback on the plan in the next few
months, and the Board of Health - the governing body of the district, comprised
of elected officials - could vote on a proposal as early as February. McGowan
said tightening the regulations on the public use of the devices is a preventive
measure meant to protect the public from potential secondhand effects. It's also
sure to draw objections from vapers and the people who sell to them.

Though vaping omits the carcinogenic smoke of cigarettes, conclusive research
about the health effects is scant. Still, the district argues that we know
enough to be concerned: Nicotine is toxic and addictive, and ""the inhaled and
exhaled aerosol has toxic chemicals known to cause cancer, such as cadmium and
formaldehyde, as well as ultrafine particles that can irritate the lungs,""
according to a district news release.

The use of electronic cigarettes is booming, and at least part of the appeal is
the notion that they are safer than regular cigarettes. The battery-operated
devices produce a nicotine vapor from a liquid solution. One regional vape shop
calls itself ""Cheating Death,"" and the idea of their supposed safety has been a
big part of the marketing push for the $3 billion industry. The devices are
unregulated by the state or federal government, and the products are widely
available.

Health officials are left asking: Are e-cigarettes a potential tool for
improving the health of current smokers, or are they another foot in the door
for an unhealthy addiction? And if they are indeed safer than cigarettes, is
that good enough?

Great Britain's chief public health agency recently declared that the devices
were far less destructive than cigarettes - calling them 95 percent safer, and
saying they should be regulated as aids for quitting smoking. That conclusion
drew headlines around the world, but it also drew sharp rebukes from some in the
scientific community.

The Lancet, a respected British medical journal, said there is virtually no hard
evidence for the 95 percent claim and noted that researchers involved in
devising the estimates had conflicts of interest.

Public health agencies are moving toward regulating the devices just as
cigarettes are regulated. That's the World Health Organization's position, and
the FDA has sought to regulate e-cigarettes, a proposal that is caught up in
challenges and politics. Several cities and counties around the country have
already adopted indoor bans similar to the one that Spokane County would be
considering, including four Washington counties: Clark, King, Pierce and Grant.

Boston University researcher Dr. Avrum Spira was one of the first scientists to
receive FDA funding to investigate e-cigarettes. He characterizes the question
this way: ""In theory - and how they're marketed - e-cigarettes are a safer
product because they don't have tobacco, which has known carcinogens. The
question is: Does safer mean safe?""

McGowan takes a similar line. She said that even if vaping is safer than
cigarettes, it doesn't mean it's safe -  particularly when it comes to questions
of secondhand vapor and its effects on people who aren't part of the e-cigarette
boom.

""We need to take steps to protect people from breathing secondhand vapor because
we don't know what's in there,"" she said.

'Vaping' is not similar to smoking; Quebec's proposed new tobacco law is
ill-conceived

BYLINE: IAN IRVINE, The Gazette

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 653 words","


Quebec's Bill 44 - An Act to Bolster Tobacco Control, is both inappropriately
titled and inappropriately formulated. It conflates very different products into
a single category, gives draconian powers to governments and prohibits
individuals from freely choosing for themselves.

As it stands, Quebec's Tobacco Act (to be renamed the Tobacco Control Act) is
designed to protect youth from the lure of smoking, to protect non-smokers from
second-hand smoke and to protect smokers from themselves by limiting their
nicotine intake in various ways.

But the arrival of electronic cigarettes has changed the market for nicotine
consumption and related non-nicotine consumption dramatically. In fact,
""e-cigarette"" is really a misnomer. Electronic devices vaporize, rather than
burn, a liquid that may or may not contain nicotine. The absence of burning
means that the production of tar, a substance

that can cause severe health problems, is dramatically reduced and perhaps
eliminated. Hence, users prefer the term ""vaping"" to ""smoking.""

The central problem with Bill 44 is that it treats several distinct products as
if they were identical. The second paragraph of the bill states that tobacco
will now be defined to include ""electronic cigarettes and any other devices of
that nature that are put in one's mouth to inhale any substance that may or may
not contain nicotine, including their components and accessories."" However,
vaping a flavoured vegetable liquid, whether nicotine-free or otherwise, is not
the same as burning and inhaling tar and other smoking byproducts in high doses.

As a specific example of the draconian nature of the legislation, Section 50
empowers the authorities to levy a fine of up to $600,000, for a second offence,
on individuals who either distribute ""tobacco"" (possibly nicotine-free vape
juice) free of charge or who offer bulk discounts on its purchase. This latter
provision would seem to preclude selling a 60-mL container of e-juice at less
than twice the price of a 30-mL container. It might also preclude selling a
highconcentration e-juice with twice the nicotine content of a low-concentration
liquid at less than twice the price.

Bill 44 also proposes to extend the prohibition on smoking in bars to outdoor
terrasses. And since vaping is now as serious as inhaling conventional tobacco,
vapers will be limited to inhaling the fumes from passing motor vehicles,
without having the right to inhale peaches-andcream or toffee-and-hazelnut
e-liquid.

The hospitality industry is currently conducting studies on the potential
economic impact of the smoking and vaping ban on terrasses. But beyond the
economics, a society that respects the rights of individuals to consume legal
products should allow them to smoke and vape outdoors within the confines of a
property belonging to a merchant.

This freedom need not imply that every bar permit smoking and vaping at all
times on their terrasses. Some bars could allow smoking and vaping, subject to a
permit, and some could not. Merchants could make their choices and advertise
accordingly. Customers could then gravitate to bars with terrasses polluted only
by automobiles, or bars with terrasses where they could also produce and inhale
smoke or vapour. This would allow Quebec sellers and buyers the right of
association without forcing non-smokers and non-vapers to inhale secondhand
smoke or vapour.

In fact, such a flexible system might provide us with a model for further
modifying tobacco control in such a way that the rights of all individuals in
society are respected. In contrast, Bill 44, with its misguided definition of
what constitutes tobacco, combined with ruinous penalties, models a
paternalistic lack of respect for individual rights. Ian Irvine is a professor

Ontario delays ban on vaping, devices; Public locales

SECTION: CANADA; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 229 words","

DATELINE: TORONTO


Ontario's Liberal government is delaying plans to ban vaping and the use of
electronic cigarettes in public places.

The ban on e-cigarettes in public spaces and workplaces was supposed to go into
effect Jan. 1, but Associate Health Minister Dipika Damerla says it will be
delayed until later in the year.

She said the ban on selling e-cigarettes to minors under the age of 19 will go
into force Jan. 1, but not the regulation limiting where adults can and cannot
use them.

The government promised to review regulations around where marijuana can and
cannot be vaped in November, just one day after an exemption for medical
marijuana users to the vaporizing law came to light.

Damerla said the government has decided of bring in all the regulations
concerning vaping at the same time, which is why the ban in public places is
being delayed.

Until the ban is enacted, employers and restaurant owners can still ban medical
marijuana users from vaping on their premises.

The regulations define a vaporizer as an electronic cigarette or other device
that contains a power source and an element designed to heat a substance to
produce a vapour to be inhaled.

Also Jan. 1, the province will ban the sale of flavoured tobacco products and
increase maximum fines for youth-related sales offences under the Smoke-Free
Ontario Act. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.

Vaping is of little danger to bystanders, Letter Jan. 4

Some questions for PhD student Amelia Howard, who suggests that there is not
enough research to ban indoor smoking of fake cigarettes, or ""vaping."" Is that
not what the tobacco companies said about real cigarettes until just a few years
ago?

Do you not think that young children watching people smoking in restaurants and
shopping malls will not want to try it also? What about reformed smokers
watching ""vapeurs"" and fondly remembering the pleasures of smoking. Do you not
think this may make some former smokers crave a smoke, and return to the
addiction?

Printing shop smokes out new opportunity with e-cigarettes

BYLINE: Becca Choules

LENGTH: 358  words","


A printing shop is probably the last place you would expect to find smoking
products - but there is a certain logic to Cartridge World's move into such a
different market.

The Parton Road store is now selling the Vapouriz e-cigarette kits which have
been billed as the healthier alternative' to traditional smoking.

These kits include the cartridges in which the vaping liquid is poured in -
hence the reasoning behind the move.

Cartridge World Aylesbury's director Martin Dyckhoff said: ""It's the classic new
year's day resolution. To do something as significant as giving up smoking, you
need to do it in stages. Often, people are expected to go cold turkey and still
fuction, but with vaping they have the ability to vary the level of nicotine in
the e-cigaette and still have something to do with their hands. It's a beautiful
thing.

""It's taken us a while to get on board, as I know other stores have been selling
them for a while, but we were determined to go with the same approach we've
always gone with - to havelots of choice.""

The vaping liquid contains just a small percentage of nicotine instead of the
2,000 other harmful ingredients commonly found in cigarettes.

The e-cigarette itself is made up of a rechargable battery and the other half is
a cartridge where the vaping fluid is poured in. It works when the battery
heating up the liquid and vaporising' it into a water-based vapour, mimicking
the act of smoking a normal tobacco cigarette.

Customers can choose three different strengths of nicotine - from 0% to 2.4% -
in more than 65 flavours, including ice mint, menthol, chocolate and vanilla.

Martin, who lives in Cuddington, said: ""If you're a heavy smoker, switching to
vaping can save you £40 a week. It's astonishing.""

Cartridge World Aylesbury sales manager David Dilworth is a former smoker
himself and succesfully kicked the habit by vaping.

Martin says David has helped the team understand the habit.

Martin, who runs the Cartridge World franchise with wife Sarah, said: ""He said
to me Martin, my clothes no longer smell, my breath  no longer smells, and I
don't have to worry about popping a mint before going into a meeting!'.""

Washington: Norton Amendment Banning Use of E-Cigarettes and Other Electronic
Smoking Devices on Airplanes Passes Committee

LENGTH: 948 words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: Office of the MP Eleanor Holmes Norton has issued the following
news release:



 Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), a senior Member of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, today got one of the few Democratic
amendments passed during the committee markup of a controversial bill to
reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.  Norton's amendment would
prohibit the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices for smoking on
airplanes.  Her amendment passed with a bipartisan vote of 33-26 after a
spirited debate, which included Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) pulling out
his own vaporizer and taking a puff.





 ""I am surprised by the strong margin by which my amendment passed, but I
introduced it by reminding Members that nearly 30 years ago we banned smoking on
airplanes,"" Norton said.  ""Despite the best efforts of Representative Hunter,
who came equipped with his vaping device and demonstrated its use, Members were
not impressed enough to defeat my amendment.  The Member sitting next to Rep.
Hunter even fanned away the smoke emitted from the vaporizer, illustrating my
point about second-hand smoke.  On a serious note, though, I reminded Members of
the countless lives lost after it took us decades to ban smoking on airplanes
and elsewhere and asked that there be no repeat of such a delay on electronic
cigarettes and vaping devices.""



 Norton first introduced this provision as a standalone bill last October after
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a rule prohibiting passengers
and crewmembers from carrying battery-powered portable electronic smoking
devices in checked baggage, which did not ban the use of these vaping devices on
airplanes.  Norton said these devices pose significant fire and health risks to
airplane passengers. Norton said that although some individual airlines have
banned the use of e-cigarettes and vaping devices on airplanes, a federal ban is
necessary to cover all airlines.



 Below is Norton's full statement introducing the amendment.



 STATEMENT OF

 THE HONORABLE ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

 COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

 AMENDMENT TO BAN THE USE OF E-CIGARETTES ON AIRPLANES



 FEBRUARY 11, 2016



 My amendment prohibits the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices on
commercial airplanes by including use of these devices within the definition of
smoking.  Smoking tobacco products on commercial airplanes has been banned for
years, but with the increase in use of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices,
it is necessary to update our laws to reflect this new nuisance and health risk
on airplanes.  The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in 2011 to ban the use of these devices on commercial
airplanes, but four years later, no progress has been made.  DOT issued a rule
in October banning e-cigarettes from checked bags, but DOT has not taken the
additional step of banning the use of e-cigarettes on airplanes.  Therefore,
Congress should step in to legislatively resolve this issue, particularly
considering the increasing popularity of electronic cigarettes.



 Electronic cigarette use has increased over the last decade with the increased
education of the general public about the dangers and public health threats
caused by traditional cigarettes to smokers and nonsmokers alike.  For example,
between 2010 and 2011, e-cigarette use among adults doubled.  Researchers and
public health experts have voiced concerns over the use of electronic cigarettes
because there are still so many unknowns about the chemicals these devices can
produce.  The American Lung Association (ALA) has cited many concerns about the
lack of regulation of e-cigarettes because they are on the market while the
potential harm from e-cigarette secondhand exposure remains unknown.  ALA has
identified two studies that show formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene,
tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and other harmful irritants coming from
e-cigarette emissions.  In addition, the temperature of an e-cigarette can
affect how harmful the chemicals are, but with no configuration standards, it is
too difficult to uniformly assess the health effects of smoking e-cigarettes.



 This year, we celebrate 25 years since legislation was passed banning smoking
on domestic flights in the United States.  The current smoking ban applies to
the smoking of tobacco products on all scheduled passenger flights and on
scheduled passenger flight segments on foreign air carriers in the U.S. and
between the U.S. and foreign countries, unless a waiver is granted based on
bilateral negotiations.



 In 2011, DOT issued an NPRM to prohibit the use of e-cigarettes on U.S.
airplanes.  Under current FAA policy, battery-powered electronic cigarettes,
vaporizers, vape pens, atomizers, and electronic nicotine systems are prohibited
in checked baggage, and the FAA recommends that such devices only be carried in
the aircraft cabins because of safety issues.  It is up to individual airlines
to ban their use.  Some airlines have already taken the initiative to institute
a ban on the use of electronic cigarettes, but legislation is necessary to make
this update applicable to all airlines, and permanent.  The amendment will
change the statutory definition of smoking in 49 U.S.C. 41706 to include the use
of electronic cigarettes, defined as ""a device that delivers nicotine or other
substances to a user of the device in the form of a vapor that is inhaled to
simulate the experience of smoking.""



 I urge the adoption of this amendment.

Vaping added to Mercer County Clean Indoor Air ordinance

BYLINE: Greg Jordan, Bluefield Daily Telegraph, W.Va.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 335 words","


June 11--BLUEFIELD -- Mercer County users of electronic nicotine devices, also
known as vaping devices, will now have to limit their vaping to areas designated
for smoking in public.

Electronic nicotine devices, also known as e-cigarettes, were added Wednesday to
Mercer County's indoor air regulations. The Mercer County Board of Health voted
unanimously to add e-cigarettes and their definition to the county ordinances
regulating smoking in public places.

The devices, which deliver nicotine to their users with vapor instead of smoke
like regular cigarettes, will be limited to the same areas where cigarettes are
allowed, according to Susan Kadar, administrator of the Mercer County Health
Department.

The amended ordinance goes into effect immediately, but the public will be given
a 30-day period of adjustment before enforcement begins, Kadar said.

Under the amended clean air regulations, vape shops that sell nicotine devices
and supplies will be in the same category as retail tobacco shops that do not
have a food service permit, Kadar said.

There were questions about vape shops that sell other items besides devices and
supplies, Dr. Robert Stevens, a member of the board of health, said. If
customers are using the devices, there would be the possibility of other people
being exposed to the devices' vapor while they shopped for other merchandise.

""We would have to look at it on a case by case basis,"" Kadar said after the
board meeting. Whether a waiver would be granted to a business on the basis of
its ventilation would have to be presented to the board of health.

Tony Colosi, co-owner of the Sly Foxx Shoppe on Mercer Street in Princeton, said
later at his store if anything new such as dividing vaping from other sections
of a business is included in the amended ordinance, it needs to be brought back
to a public forum.

Wolves lift ban on e-cigs at Halliwell Jones after signing new sponsorship deal

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 332 words","


WARRINGTON Wolves will now be able to smoke an electric cigarette after the club
lifted its ban.

It coincides with a new sponsorship deal which will see Truvape take over
sponsorship of the South Stand.

Wolves branded e-cigs will also be on sale in the Wolves shop.

Smoking electronic cigarettes was previously banned at The Halliwell Jones
Stadium.

A club spokesman said: ""Wolves' decision to reverse the vaping ban follows a
similar decision by the O2 Arena in 2013, when they teamed up with another
e-cigarette brand and reversed their own vaping ban, allowing their guests the
ability to vape without having to leave the O2 grounds.""

Alex Wilson, Wolves' commercial manager, said: ""We are firmly committed to
helping our fans make informed choices, particularly when it comes to health and
fitness.

""Obviously the best option is to never smoke at all, but as a percentage of our
fans are already smokers, we are pleased to be able to encourage them to
consider switching to alternatives by allowing vaping in certain areas of the
stadium, as well as providing a branded vapouriser that can be purchased on
site.

""We initially introduced the vaping ban as a 'just in case' measure, but are now
happy to reverse this as more news on the industry comes to light.

""The fact that more than two million people in the UK alone have already
converted to vaping shows that this is an industry that is here to stay.

""We believe this partnership, with a reputable brand like TRUVAPE - known for
their attention to safety and adherence to regulations - will help our fans
enjoy a better matchday experience, and provide those who smoke with an
alternative that experts believe has the potential to hugely reduce harm.""

Lee Bryan, M.D. of TRUVAPE, added: ""We are very excited about this partnership.

""The synergy between Wolves and TRUVAPE in terms of both branding and fan base
is excellent.

""We are looking forward to working with Warrington Wolves in helping their fans
make the conversion from smoking to vaping"".

Ontario should support vaping

The danger of inhaling cigarette smoke is well known. Earlier this year, the
British government released a report that methodically and objectively assessed
risks of e-cigarettes (vaping).

The results are clear as per this comment directly from the report: ""In a
nutshell, best estimates show e-cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful to your
health than normal cigarettes, and when supported by a smoking cessation
service, help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether.""

The Ontario government is ignoring this study. In fact, the government proposes
restrictive controls mimicking cigarette legislation. If fully implemented, the
existing vaping industry could be irreparably damaged and a proven alternative
to smoking could be stifled. This will impact Ontario citizens trying to quit
smoking.

This vaping legislation is in direct violation of the foundations of the Ontario
Public Health Standard, which pledges to improve the overall health, wellness
and resilience of the population as a whole.

It is counterintuitive for the Ontario government to impose such severe
regulations when the British report has documented notable, positive advantages
and health-risk mitigation when vaping compared to smoking.

Vaping advocate says Howard council should take inspiration from Baltimore law

BYLINE: Amanda Yeager, Howard County Times, Columbia, Md.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 952 words","


June 17--Howard County should follow Baltimore's lead and allow bars and
restaurants to choose whether or not to allow vaping, rather than banning the
practice altogether, the leader of an association of vaping businesses told the
County Council Monday night.

The suggestion was part of testimony on a new bill, introduced by Democratic
Councilman Jon Weinstein, that would incorporate vaping, or smoking electronic
cigarettes, into the current ban on traditional cigarette smoking in public
places. The law prohibits smoking in public areas, including bars and
restaurants, offices, stores and open-air venues, such as sports arenas and
concert pavilions.

Last November, the Baltimore City Council passed a law banning electronic
cigarettes in most of the city's public places, with an exception for bars and
restaurants that decide to allow vaping in their establishments.

E-cigarettes are a relatively new phenomenon in the United States -- the
National Institute of Health's National Institute on Drug Abuse says they have
been available to Americans since 2007.

The devices, which are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
have sparked controversy as their use has grown.

Opponents worry about their potential impact on health, while supporters say
e-cigarettes are playing a role in helping smokers quit traditional cigarettes
by offering up a cleaner source of nicotine.

""Vapor products are creating ex-smokers every day in Maryland, and this council
should take no action that would actively discourage smokers to stop smoking,""
Gregory Conley, the president of the American Vaping Association, a nonprofit
supported by small and medium-sized vaping businesses, told council members.

But Michaeline Fedder, government relations director for the American Heart
Association, called e-cigarettes ""dangerous"" and pointed to lack of oversight
for their manufacturers, as well as the potential for small children to
accidentally drink the nicotine-containing vapor ""juice"" and for older ones to
become addicted to vaping.

""The bottom line for us is it should be treated exactly how cigarettes are
treated,"" she said.

Though Conley and Fedder were the only people to testify in person Monday night,
six more individuals and organizations -- including the American Cancer Society
and the Maryland Group Against Smoker's Pollution -- sent testimony in support
of the bill.

""I work in a bar/restaurant and do not want to be forced to inhale unknown
substances in my workplace!"" Rosalee Bennett, who lives in Chester, Md., wrote.

Tuesday, Weinstein said he didn't expect to make any changes to his bill.

""I need to take a look at more detail that has been offered as suppoting
evidence"" for assertions made by Conley and Fedder, he said, but ""I think right
now it's pretty solid and reflects the direction I want to go.""

Garber nomination

Supporters, and a few opponents, of Susan Garber's nomination to the Planning
Board turned out in force Monday night to testify on her appointment.

The high level of attendance was a deviation from the usually routine
appointment process, in which council members typically approve the county
executive's appointments to boards and commissions without much discussion.

Garber's appointment, however, has generated debate over the past few weeks.

While supporters point to her years of community involvement, opponents of her
nomination say they object to some of her past positions, particularly a July
2014 editorial in The Howard County Times that characterized the Howard County
Education Association as ""greedy"" and ""manipulative.""

In a letter to the council, HCEA President Paul Lemle called Garber's remarks,
written during a stand-still in negotiations between the union and the public
school system's administration, ""inflammatory"" and ""unfair.""

""The association has serious doubts that Ms. Garber will treat the people of our
county with the kindness, dignity, and respect they deserve,"" Lemle wrote.

Though most of the people who testified Monday night supported Garber's
appointment -- 16 of the 18 were in favor -- the council heard from 52 others,
mostly teachers, who were opposed.

Savage resident Ron Coleman said he thought the critiques related to Garber's
editorial were irrelevant. ""The criticism lodged at her this past weekend has
absolutely nothing to do with the affairs of the Planning Board,"" he said.

Coleman and others said Garber's enthusiasm and experience as a former special
education teacher, program director for the Johns Hopkins University/Maryland
State Department of Education Center for Technology in Human Disabilities (now
the Center for Technology in Education) and founder of the nonprofit AT:LAST
qualified her for a role on the Planning Board, which reviews development plans
for proposed projects across the county.

If appointed, Garber would replace board chair Josh Tzuker, whose five-year term
ended in May. Tzuker, who is eligible to serve three more years, has said he was
""surprised"" by County Executive Allan Kittleman's decision not to renew his
term.

Garber, who leads the Savage Community Association and has been a community
volunteer and activist for many years, told the council she looked forward ""to
involvement at a time when the county faces new challenges and opportunities"" if
her appointment is confirmed.

""I'll apply the rules as written, guided by my intent to promote the health,
safety and wellness of the community,"" she said.

The council is expected to vote on Garber's appointment and the vaping bill in
early July.

E-cig or cig, smoking is haraam: Scholars

BYLINE: Ahmed Shaaban

LENGTH: 521 words","


Reasons: Health implications, wastage of money.

The latest 'in thing' these days is the vaping craze in several countries since
it was introduced about five years ago. However, Muslim scholars here have said
that vaping and e-cigarettes are stringently prohibited in Islam due to its
health implications and because they are a ""waste of money"".

Dr Ali Ahmed Mashael, Chief Mufti at the Department of Islamic Affairs and
Charitable Activities in Dubai, told Khaleej Times that e-cigarettes are not
only forbidden according to Islamic Sharia but are rather a ""two-fold sin"".

""Vaping (inhaling and exhaling the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette or
similar device) is as haraam (forbidden) as regular smoking owing to its harmful
effects on the health of smokers and those around them.""

Warning, Dr Mashael said some companies are only interested in making money and
disregard that these e-cigarettes can have any negative impact on people's
health as is the case with regular smoking which is haram in Islam.

""The same applies to such e-cigarettes which can be filled with liquids
including nicotine, and other harmful substances.""

Some people claim that they resort to e-cigarette to give up regular ones, but
that is not acceptable as well, he added. ""One should give up smoking with a
firm will seeking forgiveness from Almighty Allah for the sin he has been
committing.""

Such shift from cigarettes to e-cigarettes is rarely helpful as it sometimes
gives options which might be more harmful than regular cigarettes and shisha, Dr
Mashael said. ""Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was reported as saying:
'There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm', and that applies to
vaping.""

Prominent scholar Shaikh Yusuf Ali said Muslims are also advised to never waste
their money, and the Holy Quran states: 'Spendthrift people are brothers to
devils'.

""When Muslims are prohibited from eating or drinking too much halal (healthy and
permissible) foods, how can they be allowed to consume anything harmful?""

Renowned scholar Dr Shaikh Mohammed Ashmawy said some people, mostly youngsters,
believe that e-cigarette is halal or permissible and that has led to widespread
use of electronic cigarettes.

""Vaping is worse than using tobacco, and specialists confirm that it is more
detrimental to health than normal cigarettes,"" he opined.

According to some media reports, last week Malaysia's National Fatwa Council
declared e-cigarettes and vaping forbidden (haraam) for Muslims in an attempt to
'prevent an unhealthy culture from spreading to future generations'

Media reports quoted Dr Abdul Shukor Husin, chairman of the council, as saying
that the decision followed careful consideration of health implications of
vaping, indicating that the decision is in line with the opinions of several
other Muslim countries including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE.

How to give up smoking, according to a scholar

A scholar has said that one should give up smoking with a firm will seeking
forgiveness from Almighty Allah for the sin he has been committing.

SUNDAY, JAN. 25

Proposed vaping ban

Democratic Rep. Debra Kolste of Janesville is looking to have the state do what
several Wisconsin cities have already done: subject electronic cigarette
smoking, or vaping, to an existing smoking ban. The state's smoking ban took
effect in 2010.

Municipalities including Madison and Green Bay have banned indoor vaping in
public places.

Republicans aren't fired up adding vaping to the state's ban, with one calling
it a ""nanny state"" move.

MONDAY, JAN. 26

Big cut, more freedom

As part of his 2015-17 budget proposal, Gov. Scott Walker wants to cut state
funding to the University of Wisconsin System by 13 percent, or about $300
million. The System had requested a $95 million increase.

In return, Walker would allow the System to become a public authority, allowing
it the freedom to make human resources, procurement, construction and other
decisions on its own.

A tuition freeze would remain for the next two years, but not after that.

TUESDAY, JAN. 27

Walker 2016; UW's challenge

Walker moves closer to running for president in 2016 by announcing the creation
this month of a tax-exempt exploratory committee called ""Our American Revival.""
Unlike a formal campaign committee, the group can raise unlimited donations.

Also, UW System and UW-Madison officials say it will be a rough two years ahead
if Walker's budget cut and tuition freeze are enacted, but more operational
autonomy post-2017 is a plus.

WEDNESDAY, JAN. 28

On the block; UW's Act 10

The owners of the last significant undeveloped piece of lakefront land in Monona
say they could sell it. The nearly 10-acre San Damiano priests' residence and
property on Lake Monona is expected to be vacant in March.

Also, Walker suggests UW System faculty and staff work more as one way to lessen
the impact of his proposed $300 million state aid cut and tuition freeze, a plan
whose impact he likened to 2011's union-curtailing Act 10.

THURSDAY, JAN. 29

Cross defends UW

UW System President Ray Cross takes offense at Walker's suggestion that faculty
simply work more to help cover the impact of his proposed $300 million in cuts
to System funding. ""I don't like to see faculty vilified,"" he says. ""I believe
some of this is rhetoric and a lack of understanding, and we need to do a better
job of explaining."" A study last year of workloads at UW-Madison found that
faculty across 11 departments work an average of 63 hours a week.

FRIDAY, JAN. 30

Walker goes to Washington

Walker offers a preview of his likely presidential campaign themes, criticizing
Washington, D.C., as a city of power-hungry elites during a speech delivered a
block from the White House complex at the American Action Forum. Borrowing a
favorite description of Madison, Walker called Washington ""68 square miles
surrounded by reality"" and sounded familiar campaign themes as he looked to
build interest in his potential campaign.

Don't Vanquish Vaping;
France's plan to ban e-cigarettes in public is muddle-headed

SECTION: EDITORIAL; OPINION; LEADING ARTICLES; Pg. 32

LENGTH: 305 words","


Picture the archetypal French person. He or she is probably smoking,
insouciantly. About one in five French adults smokes every day and 73,000 die
each year from a related illness. France imposed a full ban on smoking in public
places in 2008. Now the French health minister, Marisol Touraine, wants to go
further and make France the first European country to ban e-cigarettes in public
places. This is a foolish idea that must not be emulated on this side of the
Channel.

Figures compiled by Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), a charity that campaigns
against tobacco use, show that the proportion of adult smokers in Britain using
e-cigarettes has increased sixfold since 2010, from 3 per cent to 18 per cent.
The two most frequent reasons smokers give for ""vaping"" are that it helps them
both to stop smoking and then to return to it. Yet if using e-cigarettes in
public places is banned, vapers will be driven to the smokers sheds alongside
tobacco addicts, inevitably making them far more likely to return to using
conventional cigarettes.

A key claim used by proponents of a ban is that vaping is a gateway for young
people into conventional smoking. This is unsupported by evidence. The number of
e-cigarette users, adults and children alike, who have never smoked tobacco was
found by Ash to be ""negligible"". In any case, it is fanciful to think that
children will be driven to tobacco by witnessing adults vaping. If anything,
they will be driven to harmless vaping.

In this country the proportion of adult smokers has halved in the past 40 years.
E-cigarettes offer a chance to wean still more people off tobacco, one of the
greatest killers of our age. Restricting their use means forgoing a powerful way
of easing the burden that smoking-related illnesses place on our health
services. We must not follow the French lead.

Ban public vaping, Editorial Dec. 19

As a doctoral candidate writing a dissertation on e-cigarette science, policy
and politics, I was interested in your editorial. In arguing that the Ontario
government should not postpone a ban on vaping in public spaces, you voiced
oft-heard concerns about electronic cigarettes for which no scientific
justifications exist, and gave a misleading picture of the current evidence.

The statement, ""no one knows what the harmful effects of e-cigarettes might be .
. . to users of the devices or those exposed to second-hand vapours,"" if
referring to the state of scientific knowledge on e-cigarettes, is false. It
ignores a large body of original research and systematic reviews conducted by
nicotine and smoking experts, and a scientific consensus that the devices pose
minimal risk to their users (who are by and large former smokers or smokers
trying to quit).

There have been several studies assessing the risk of second-hand vapour to
bystanders as well, and at present there is not enough evidence to justify
indoor or outdoor bans, even on a precautionary basis.

Unlike second-hand smoke, e-cigarette emissions contain nowhere near the levels
of toxicants that would pose any meaningful risk to bystanders. The position of
apparently ""well-informed"" health advocacy groups you cited as supporting
e-cigarette bans is unreflective of current evidence-based recommendations for
the regulation of e-cigarettes in the interest of public health.

The political opposition to vapour is legitimate, as long as readers are not
made to believe it is anything but political. There is simply no evidence that
it poses a danger to bystanders. Readers should not be misled upon that fact.

Idaho: No More Smoking and Vaping with Kids in the Car Thanks to This Arizona
City's New Controversial Ordinance

LENGTH: 444  words","

DATELINE: Boise


Houseshoe Bend of Idaho has issued the following news release:

Tempe, AZ, has passed a controversial law aimed at keeping kids away from
tobacco smoke, but it's got critics up in arms over double standards.

Tempe's City Council passed an ordinance last week that fines drivers $50 if
officers catch them smoking while there is a child in the car. Any subsequent
offenses get bumped up to $100 per ticket.

But the law doesn't only include parents or other adults smoking tobacco
cigarettes. The legislation also lumps e-cigarettes into the mix, which are used
for vaping rather than smoking.

What is vaping? Vapor cigarettes use a solution that is heated within the device
to produce a vapor. E-cigarettes have become popular in recent years, with more
than four million Americans now vaping, either for smoking cessation purposes or
simply for recreational use, according to the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette
Association.

City Council members in Tempe say that not enough research exists thus far to
determine whether or not e-cigs are dangerous.

""There's just so [much] contradicting information that I still don't have clear,
consistent evidence,"" Councilman Joel Navarro said of the council's decision.

Matt Morales, executive director of the National Association of Vaping
Businesses, said that this treatment of e-cigarettes is unfair and called the
products a safer alternative to smoking. He criticized the decision and said
that it could hurt the reputation that e-cigs and similar products have in the
public eye.

There is an exception to the law, though: adults cannot be pulled over solely
for smoking or vaping when there is a child with them in the car. Police can
only issue a ticket if the driver is stopped for something else, such as having
a broken tail light, running a stop sign or speeding.

Drivers can also be cited according to how many children are present in the car.
In other words, a first time offense involving three children in the car could
cost a parent $150.

But critics think that this law is unfair, as well, such as one in Kingman,
which was the first town in Arizona to pass such a law.

Rich Thurlow, editor for the Kingman Daily Miner, asked why the offense is only
considered a secondary one.

""Why can a motorist obeying all traffic laws smoke two cigarettes at once while
a third smolders in the ashtray, with no fear of getting a citation even though
the SUV is packed with children?"" Thurlow asked of the law in Kingman.

The ordinance in Tempe will take effect on 30 days from May 21, when the
ordinance was passed.

Idaho: No More Smoking and Vaping with Kids in the Car Thanks to This Arizona
City's New Controversial Ordinance

LENGTH: 444  words","

DATELINE: Boise


Houseshoe Bend of Idaho has issued the following news release:

Tempe, AZ, has passed a controversial law aimed at keeping kids away from
tobacco smoke, but it's got critics up in arms over double standards.

Tempe's City Council passed an ordinance last week that fines drivers $50 if
officers catch them smoking while there is a child in the car. Any subsequent
offenses get bumped up to $100 per ticket.

But the law doesn't only include parents or other adults smoking tobacco
cigarettes. The legislation also lumps e-cigarettes into the mix, which are used
for vaping rather than smoking.

What is vaping? Vapor cigarettes use a solution that is heated within the device
to produce a vapor. E-cigarettes have become popular in recent years, with more
than four million Americans now vaping, either for smoking cessation purposes or
simply for recreational use, according to the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette
Association.

City Council members in Tempe say that not enough research exists thus far to
determine whether or not e-cigs are dangerous.

""There's just so [much] contradicting information that I still don't have clear,
consistent evidence,"" Councilman Joel Navarro said of the council's decision.

Matt Morales, executive director of the National Association of Vaping
Businesses, said that this treatment of e-cigarettes is unfair and called the
products a safer alternative to smoking. He criticized the decision and said
that it could hurt the reputation that e-cigs and similar products have in the
public eye.

There is an exception to the law, though: adults cannot be pulled over solely
for smoking or vaping when there is a child with them in the car. Police can
only issue a ticket if the driver is stopped for something else, such as having
a broken tail light, running a stop sign or speeding.

Drivers can also be cited according to how many children are present in the car.
In other words, a first time offense involving three children in the car could
cost a parent $150.

But critics think that this law is unfair, as well, such as one in Kingman,
which was the first town in Arizona to pass such a law.

Rich Thurlow, editor for the Kingman Daily Miner, asked why the offense is only
considered a secondary one.

""Why can a motorist obeying all traffic laws smoke two cigarettes at once while
a third smolders in the ashtray, with no fear of getting a citation even though
the SUV is packed with children?"" Thurlow asked of the law in Kingman.

The ordinance in Tempe will take effect on 30 days from May 21, when the
ordinance was passed.

Harmful or safe? The debate rages on...

BYLINE: Syarafi Kasim

SECTION: Letters; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 661 words","


RECENTLY, there has been confusion in cabinet about the issue of banning
electronic cigarettes, now more commonly known as vape.

Rural and Regional Development Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said he
wants Bumiputera entrepreneurs to continue making ""great flavours"", albeit
without the use of the controlled substance, nicotine.

But Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam said vaping could be just as
bad as smoking cigarettes.

This confusion has generated a lot of feedback and reaction from people,
especially among vapers and health practitioners.

From observation, most people started to vape or started to shift from the
conventional cigarette to vaping because it was trendy and fun.

But some people claim that shifting to vape helps them to slowly quit smoking -
which I believe is the hard-to-achieve-intention of most smokers.

A friend of mine also claimed that by vaping, he can play sports for a longer
period and breathe even better. Plus, he said, he had saved a lot of money
compared to when he was smoking, since no tax was applied on vape liquid.

Some individuals argue that they started to vape because it is considered a less
harmful alternative to smoking.

The benefits of vaping:

TO the industry - As we can see today, a lot of vape businesses are owned by
young Malays. If this business has become widespread in Malaysia, it could
somehow increase the economy of the country and affect Malaysia's gross national
product.

This is what Ismail Sabri is trying to protect. He also suggested that the
Health Ministry should discuss the controversial issue with vape entrepreneurs
to find a win-win situation.

TO smokers - For heavy smokers, it might be one of the alternatives for them to
slowly quit smoking.

The harmful side of vaping:

TO health - Vaping is not a local issue. It is a discussion that is being held
globally, including in the United States and European countries.

Although many people, organisations and websites insist that vaping is safe
because tobacco is not burned (hence, there is no inhalation of the many toxins
found in cigarette smoke), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has rejected these claims.

The FDA reported that e-cigarette cartridges and solutions contain nitrosamines,
diethylene glycol and other contaminants that are potentially harmful to humans.

The other ingredients found in e-cigarette cartridges and solutions are
relatively few, and for the most part non-toxic and non-carcinogenic, especially
in the low quantities delivered. They include nicotine, propylene glycol,
glycerin and tobacco flavouring.

Propylene glycol (PG) is 90 per cent of what the vape solution is made of. Parts
of the analysis show that diethylene glycol (DG) is also involved. DG is known
as a carcinogen which can cause cancer.

TO society - The trend has grown to the extent that it is impossible to be at
any place without bumping into vapers. Vape indirectly attracts non-smokers with
the colours and various flavours, thus leading to a higher rate of smoking
individuals.

Social media nowadays also show many underaged vapers indulging their habit in
public. In one video clip, a sister was demonstrating to her brothers how to
vape.

This kind of situation is obviously what we should be worried about. If this
continues to happen, we should prepare ourselves to see more of such scenes in
future.

Despite its worldwide popularity, very little research has been done regarding
the effects these devices have on human health.

Whether vaping will help in smoking cessation or not, whether it is less
dangerous or not, lots of research needs to be done to prove all the claims.

For the time being, the government should play an important role in deciding
what is best for its citizens.

Either proceed with regulation and face the backlash from vape dealers, or
support Ismail Sabri's proposal and enjoy the increase in the economy (which
will probably never be felt by the citizens).

'No vaping' signs pop up in Saint John following new legislation

SECTION: CITY; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 620 words","


SAINT JOHN * A new sign at the foot of the city market warning pedestrians
against ""vaping"" could become a more familiar sight after anti-smoking
legislation was amended last month.

""No vaping/smoking within nine metres,"" reads the sign, posted at the Germain
Street entrance of the market.

The sign was posted in July in accordance with the updated Smoke-Free Places
Act, said city spokeswoman Nancy Moar.

As of July 1, the use of electronic cigarettes is not permitted anywhere where
smoking regular cigarettes is also prohibited.

It means in addition to other changes to the law - including expansion of no
smoking to restaurant patios, playgrounds, beaches and walking trails - people
will no longer be able to use e-cigarettes in most public places.

""We are in the process of posting posters at applicable locations,"" Moar said in
an email. ""The posters at the market were the first ones up.""

For Barbara MacKinnon, president and CEO of the New Brunswick Lung Association,
the new law surrounding e-cigarettes is just as important from a smoking
prevention standpoint as from a health perspective.

""If the person who has quit smoking sees that behaviour, it triggers that desire
to smoke again,"" she said. ""We don't want that visual to re-normalize smoking.""

The science on the health effects of e-cigarettes is not widely understood, she
said, with new studies often contradicting each other. But she said with many
impacts unknown, it's important to err on the side of caution.

Most of e-cigarettes are shaped and look like their conventional counterparts.
They produce a vapour that resembles smoke and a glow that resembles the tip of
a cigarette. They consist of a battery-powered delivery system that vapourizes
and delivers a liquid chemical mixture that may be composed of various amounts
of nicotine, propylene glycol and other chemicals.

Those chemicals can be harmful to the lungs, MacKinnon said. She said it's
illegal to sell e-cigarettes containing nicotine in Canada, but that doesn't
mean such products are not available. Potentially high doses of nicotine can be
problematic.

""If you get a high dose of nicotine, it can send your heart rate up quite high,""
she said. ""So if you're smoking an e-cigarette with an unknown amount of
nicotine in it, you may think you're smoking the equivalent of a cigarette, but
you may be getting double-dose or more.""

According to the province's website for the chief medical officer of health,
changes to the Smoke-Free Places Act were introduced in an effort to reduce the
province's smoking rate of 19 per cent, one of the highest in Canada.

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death.

It's also about preventing children from picking up the habit, Health Minister
Victor Boudreau said in a statement.

""The recent changes are making smoking less attractive for all New Brunswickers,
especially our youth,"" he said. ""Discouraging our residents from smoking,
especially our youth, will prevent chronic diseases, lower health-care costs and
support a healthier population.""

Boudreau said data shows that Canadian youth are using e-cigarettes, which
reintroduces the act of smoking to a new generation - a problem when very little
is known about the safety of e-cigarettes.

Sheree Cambra, who was visiting Saint John from New York City on Tuesday,
noticed the city market sign as she had a cigarette on the edge of Germain
Street.

She said rules against e-cigarettes - and regular cigarettes - also exist in New
York.

""It's just prohibited everywhere,"" Cambra said, adding it doesn't bother her.

""No, I think I should quit smoking. It's a horrible thing and I agree if people
don't want to be subjected to it, they shouldn't."" !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

Internet searches reflect vaping's surge

LENGTH: 755  words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the
following news release:



 The Oxford Dictionaries selected ""vape""--as in, to smoke from an electronic
cigarette--as word of the year in 2014. It turns out that Internet users' search
behavior tells a similar story.





 Between 2009 and 2015, the number of people in the United States seeking
information online about vaping rose dramatically, according to a recent study
co-led by San Diego State University Internet health expert John W. Ayers and
University of North Carolina tobacco control expert Rebecca S. Williams as a
part of the Internet Tobacco Vendors Study.



 One finding from the story of particular concern to health officials and
researchers is that when it comes to vaping, people are by and large searching
for information on how and where to get vaping products, not for information on
quitting cigarette smoking or the health effects of vaping.



 E-cigarettes and other hand-held vaporizers began appearing on American shelves
in the mid-2000s. Since then, they've quickly risen in popularity while
regulators have been slow to adapt smoking legislation to account for these
devices.



 ""Big Tobacco has largely taken over the e-cigarette industry. Alongside
unchecked marketing and advertising, e-cigarettes have exploded online,"" Ayers
said.



 Internet users' search history bears this out. Ayers, Williams, and a team of
colleagues from across the country examined search history from Google Trends,
which includes statistics on what specific words people searched for, the search
term's popularity relative to all other concurrent searches in a specified time,
date and geographic location. From this data, the researchers can find patterns
that point to Internet searchers' apparent preferences and attitudes.



 When they looked at searches related to e-cigarettes starting in 2009, they
found a sharply rising trend through 2015 with no end in sight. For example, in
2014 there were about 8.5 million e-cigarette-related Google searches. For 2015,
their model forecasts an increase in these searchers of about 62-percent.



 Looking at geographic data, they found that e-cigarette searches have diffused
across the nation, suggesting that e-cigarettes have become a widespread
cultural phenomenon in every U.S. state. Over the same time period, searches for
e-cigarettes far outpaced other ""smoking alternatives"" such as snus (smokeless
tobacco) or nicotine gum or patches.



 The researchers published their findings today in the American Journal of
Preventive Medicine. (Note: this URL will be active after the embargo lifts)



 What most concerns the researchers, though, is that when people search for
e-cigarette information, they're using search terms like: ""best e-cig,"" ""buy
vapes"" or ""shop vaping.""



 ""One of the most surprising findings of this study was that searches for where
to buy e-cigarettes outpaced searches about health concerns or smoking
cessation,"" Williams said. ""Despite what the media and e-cigarette industry
might have you believe, there is little research evidence to support the notion
that e-cigarettes are safe or an effective tool to help smokers quit. Given
that, we think it's revealing that there were fewer searches about safety and
cessation topics than about shopping.""



 In fact, she said, searches for e-cigarette safety concerns represented less
than 1 percent of e-cigarette searches, and this number has declined over the
past two years.



 A linguistic trend also emerged from the study. The term ""vaping"" has quickly
overtaken ""e-cigarettes"" as the preferred nomenclature in the United States.
That's important for health officials and researchers to recognize, the team
noted. Surveillance of smoking trends is done primarily through surveys and
questionnaires, and knowing which terms people use can affect the accuracy of
this data.



 Also, one of the major weapons anti-smoking advocacy groups have is
counter-advertising. In the Internet age, advertisers look for specific keywords
to target their advertisements. Knowing that more people use the term ""vaping""
than ""e-cig"" helps them be more targeted and effective, Ayers said.



 ""Labels do matter,"" Ayers said. ""When you call it 'vaping,' you're using a
brand new word that doesn't have the same historical baggage as 'smoking' or
'cigarette.' They've relabeled it. Health campaigns need to recognize this so
they can keep up.""

WASHINGTON:County Board of Health adopts ordinance to restrict e-cigarette use

LENGTH: 463  words","

DATELINE: Clark County


Clark County, Washington has issued the following news release:

The Clark County Board of Health adopted legislation Thursday that subjects
inhalant delivery systems, commonly known as e-cigarettes and vaping devices, to
the same restrictions as tobacco cigarettes under the Washington State Smoking
in Public Places law. The ordinance exempts businesses that exclusively sell
inhalant delivery systems.

Ordinance No. 2015-0418 takes effect June 1. The ordinance makes it illegal to
use inhalant delivery systems in indoor public spaces, places of employment and
within 25 feet of building entrances, exits, windows that open and ventilation
intakes that serve an enclosed area where smoking is prohibited.

The exemption was written into the ordinance following public testimony at the
April 22 Board of Health meeting, when the draft ordinance was first proposed
for consideration. The exemption will allow customers to sample vaping products
inside vaping businesses. The exemption does not apply to other stores that sell
vaping products, such as supermarkets or convenience stores, or to vaping kiosks
in malls and other locations.

The ordinance does not apply to private residences unless they are used to
provide licensed child care or similar social service care. The ordinance does
not apply to any product approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
tobacco cessation or other therapeutic purposes.

The ordinance protects people from secondhand vapor from inhalant delivery
systems. This vapor can contain toxins such as formaldehyde, acrolein, tin,
toluene and aluminum, which are associated with a range of negative health
effects such as skin, eye and respiratory irritation, neurological effects,
damage to reproductive systems and premature death from heart attack or stroke.
Vapor has been found to contain higher concentrations of formaldehyde than
tobacco smoke.

""Youth will engage in behavior they see modeled by adults. This ordinance will
help prevent normalization of smoking and vaping,"" said Dr. Alan Melnick, Clark
County Health Officer. ""We've seen an alarming rise of e-cigarette use among
Clark County youth and are concerned that normalizing this behavior could
promote nicotine addiction and wipe out recent gains in lowering rates of
cigarette smoking.""

To help local businesses comply with the ordinance, Public Health is offering
free signage and will provide information to food establishments during plan
review, permit and inspection processes. For signs, call (360) 397-8000 ext.
7378.

In 2011, the Board of Health, whose members also serve as the Board of County
Councilors, passed an ordinance prohibiting the sale of e-cigarettes to minors.

Why HUD should allow vaping in public housing

LENGTH: 1434 words","

DATELINE: Lahore



    Washington: American Enterprise Institute has issued the following news
release:


 The Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, plans to initiate a ban
on smoking. The new rule would affect more than 700,000 public housing units
including over 500,000 units inhabited by elderly households or younger people
with disabilities. Last week, the agency opened a 60-day public comment period.


    One can readily understand the public health reasons for a smoking ban. But
there are troubling implications for the smokers themselves. After all, who
lives in public housing? Disabled individuals, the mentally ill, the recently
homeless, and extremely low income people are disproportionately housed in
public facilities relative to the community as a whole. Each of these subgroups
smokes a lot. Roughly half of mentally ill people smoke, and about eighty
percent of homeless individuals do. Without access to cigarettes, many of these
individuals (the mentally ill, in particular) may experience exacerbation of
psychiatric symptoms.
 A recent CDC report on smoking prevalence found 29.1 per cent of Medicaid
recipients smoke as do 27.9 per cent of uninsured people. These rates are more
than double the 12.9 per cent who are privately insured. Disabled patients with
impaired mobility tend to be house-bound and the 25-foot no-smoking perimeter
would be an extra burden to them.
 One way to deal with a smoking ban is to allow electronic cigarettes. As of
now, a vaping ban is not part of the proposed rule, which is limited to
&ldquo;lit tobacco products.&rdquo; Nonetheless, HUD says it &ldquo;encourages
Public Housing Authorities that already have smoke-free policies to consider
whether ENDS, [electronic nicotine delivery devices], should be included in
their smoke-free policies.&rdquo;
 If authorities do consider enfolding e-cigarettes in this ban, they should
decisively reject it.
 Vaping should be allowed within one&rsquo;s own apartment and in designated
common and outside areas (if not all outside areas).
 The reason is obvious. If you want people to change long-standing habits, you
need to give them an alternative. Yes, there are patches and gum for smokers but
the fail rate is high: between 80 and 90 percent of people who try them
don&rsquo;t succeed. Those who fail need another lower-risk option: electronic
cigarettes.
 In short, because vaping products do not burn tobacco, they do not produce
cancer-causing tar. The long term effect of inhaled propylene glycol, a
constituent of the nicotine-laced &ldquo;e-liquid&rdquo; that is heated in
e-cigarettes, remains unknown, but the short and intermediate term effects are
negligible to non-existent. Cleary, the risk to lung and cardiovascular health
is far less with e-cigarettes relative to traditional, combustible cigarettes.
 A no-vaping rule would hit these subgroups especially hard. A prohibition
against replacing smoking with vaping &ndash; and thereby removing an option to
help them quit disease-producing cigarettes &mdash; would fly in the face of the
federal government&rsquo;s much touted commitment to reducing health
disparities.
 Although HUD takes no official stand on the permissibility of vaping, its
document laying out the proposed rule presents an incomplete and worrisome
description of it&ndash; one that would surely lead local housing administrators
unfamiliar with the practice to take a dim view. &ldquo;The aerosol from ENDS
typically contains nicotine derived from tobacco plants, and may contain other
hazardous and potentially hazardous constituents such as formaldehyde and
lead.&rdquo;
 Yes, ENDS contain nicotine. But it is not a danger to bystanders (nor to most
users). What&rsquo;s more, lead and formaldehyde are present at levels that are
not biologically meaningful.
 The two studies marshaled by HUD to support the presence of toxins are
selective. One citation is from the CDC and cites a 2014 paper in the journal
Tobacco Control. That paper, oddly, is actually quite reassuring. As its authors
conclude: &ldquo;We found that the e-cigarette vapours contained some toxic
substances. The levels of the toxicants were 9&ndash;450 times lower than in
cigarette smoke and were, in many cases, comparable with trace amounts found in
the reference product.&rdquo;
 The second citation flags a study by F. J. Offerman, president of the San
Francisco-based Indoor Environmental Engineering, a consulting firm specializing
in healthy building design. He cites his own work revealing unacceptable levels
of metals, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in the aerosol. Offerman&rsquo;s
research, however, is not peer reviewed. Had it been, a glaring methodological
problem would have been noted, says Riccardo Polosa, Director of the Institute
for Internal Medicine and Clinical Immunology of the University of Catania in
Italy.
 As Polosa told me: &ldquo;Offerman and collaborators assume that 100% of the
vapor that is inhaled gets absorbed by the user. This is wrong &ndash; since a
substantial proportion of e-cigarette vapor is visibly exhaled by the users. But
surprisingly, when they try to assess the impact of environmental exposure, they
assume the exact opposite: that 100% of the vapor is exhaled by the user. And
even worse they assume that &ndash; when this vapor is released to the
environment &ndash; 100% absorbed by the bystanders!&rdquo; (Notably, Offerman
also relies on the 2014 paper in Tobacco Control mentioned above but because his
calculations only took into account the maximum levels of potentially harmful
constituents &mdash; not the average &mdash; from the 2014 study, he puts an
ominous spin on what are clearly benign findings.)
 Meanwhile, the HUD document failed to include three recent studies
demonstrating that the toxins in vaping aerosol are not detectable or are
present only in very low concentrations well below one twentieth of that in
cigarette smoke.
 Let&rsquo;s pause for an Orwellian moment. Concern about enforcement of anti-
vaping, also expressed by HUD, seems frankly bizarre given the rampant problems
with illicit drug use, crime and resident intimidation by dealers and gangs in
many public housing developments. It&rsquo;s one thing if vaping were a
&ldquo;broken window&rdquo; imperative wherein pursuing small deviances makes
sense because tolerating them sets the stage for larger transgressions. But
vaping is not only a positive move for smokers&rsquo; health and a negligible
threat to bystanders, it is a viable way to help make public housing smoke-free.

 There are yet other rationales to allow vaping in one&rsquo;s own apartment.
For one thing, anti-vaping rules would be unenforceable as no tell-tale odor
would be detected in hallways. Therefore, if not allowed to vape, many people
will continue to smoke, particularly because there are no meaningful
consequences for doing so (HUD says it would not evict smokers). So, not only is
a deadly habit perpetuated, untold thousands of dollars are wasted annually as
vaping is considerably cheaper than smoking, despite a larger upfront cost
depending upon the device used.
 And the savings translate:
 Here is one of my colleagues, David Sweanor of the University of Ottawa Faculty
of Law: &ldquo;Sajama, a Bosnian refugee who worked for me as a cleaning lady,
went from spending over $80 a week on cigarettes to $25 every two weeks at a
vape shop. She, like many others with whom I have talked, said she used to go
into a store and have to choose between food and cigarettes. Cigarettes always
won. By moving to vaping she not only ate better but saved enough money to have
her first trip back to Bosnia.&rdquo;
 Finally, what about other menaces that lurk in public housing, such as lead?
The CDC acknowledges that &ldquo;Lead-based paint is the most common source of
high-dose lead poisoning [and that] [c]omplete abatement of the lead hazards in
the child&rsquo;s environment is the most effective and only certain way to
prevent further damage.&rdquo; But the agency also recognizes that
&ldquo;Complete abatement may not always be possible, and shorter term,
preventive maintenance procedures may have to be undertaken to minimize the
potential for further damage.&rdquo;
 HUD should apply the harm-reduction logic embedded in its approach to lead to
its anti-smoking policy. That is, to borrow HUD&rsquo;s language: while use of
nicotine may not be amenable to complete abatement, procedures such as vaping
may have to be undertaken to minimize the potential for further damage.

E-cigarette advertising triggers urge to smoke

LENGTH: 230  words","


Watching ecigarette television advertisements can make people crave for tobacco,
regardless of whether they did or did not smoke.

Researchers Erin K. Maloney, Ph.D. and Joseph N. Cappella, Ph.D. from the
University of Pennsylvania studied more than 800 daily, intermittent, and former
smokers who watched ecigarette advertising, and who then took a survey to
determine smoking urges, intentions, and behaviours.

The scientists observed a trend that more daily smokers who viewed ads with
vaping smoked a tobacco cigarette during the experiment than daily smokers who
viewed ads without vaping and daily smokers who did not view ads.

Over 35 percent of the daily smokers in the condition that showed vaping
reported having a tobacco cigarette during the study versus 22 percent of daily
smokers who saw ads without vaping, and about 23 percent of daily smokers who
did not see any advertising, said the study published in the journal Health
Communication.

They wrote that ""given the sophistication of cigarette marketing in the past and
the exponential increase in advertising dollars allotted to ecigarette promotion
in the past year, it should be expected that advertisements for these products
created by big tobacco companies will maximize smoking cues in their
advertisements, and if not regulated, individuals will be exposed to much more
ecigarette advertising on a daily basis.""

Law must cover grey areas

I REFER to your report ""Minister: Vape ban up to states"" (NST, Dec 2).   I feel
that Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam's statement, that it is up to
the respective state governments to decide whether or not to ban vaping, is
preposterous.

Johor has banned vaping from Jan 1 next year, while Malacca, and Pahang have not
done so. What is there to prevent Johoreans from going to Malacca or Pahang to
get their supply of vape products?

While the ministry is waiting for the results of scientific studies on vaping
before considering legislation, other states are considering taking the cue from
Johor. Penang is thinking of setting up vape-free zones, and Kedah wants the
state Fatwa Committee to ban or declare haram the sale of vape products to
Muslims.

 If state governments are allowed to have their own version of banning vape
products, it will encourage addicts to freely smoke vape products containing
drugs. This will lead to more drug addicts, especially among schoolchildren.

 Are not drug-smuggling, sales, and abuse a federal matter under the Dangerous
Drug Act 1952? I cannot understand the rationale of allowing state governments
to amend legislation to ban or to allow the use of vape products in their
respective states.

 Police have confiscated vape products containing dangerous drugs. State Health
directors have also said that vaping is a threat to the health of smokers,
especially children.

 It was reported recently that Johor Health Department director Datuk Mohd
Khairi Yakob said that the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control, of which Malaysia is a signatory, at its 6th conference in
Moscow, suggested last year that member states ban e-cigarettes and vape
products.

 I feel that the ministry should strongly recommend to the cabinet to enact a
new law on vaping or amend the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 to include a clause on
vaping to ban the import, smuggling, manufacture, sale, and use of e-cigarettes
and vape products. The legislation will, of course, cover all states.

Washington: Hooking Youth on Cotton Candy Nicotine

LENGTH: 648  words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: U.S Army has issued the following news release:



  Pvt. Hunter Chubb had already quit smoking. Basic Combat Training left him no
choice.



 ""That was a good thing,"" said the preventive medicine specialist with the Fort
Riley Public Health Department. ""I came to appreciate my new found freedom.""





 Weeks after completing boot camp his freedom was cut short. A friend introduced
him to the electronic cigarette. It wasn't the first time he'd seen the device.
But there was something different.



 ""It looked really cool,"" said Chubb, ""similar to owning a flip phone and seeing
a smartphone for the first time. You just really want it.""



 An array of juices, or flavored nicotine, also made vaping an appealing
recreation.



 ""'Vaping' and 'juices' are terms the industry uses to distinguish the activity
from smoking or tobacco consumption,"" said Wayne Darsow, Fort Riley Public
Health Nurse Practitioner.



 Chubb said his initial interest in the electronic device was more about the
technology and social lures.



 ""I didn't have a desire for nicotine so I started with the lightest level
available,"" he said.



 He began vaping at 6 mg/mL of chocolate flavored nicotine, which is considered
entry-level strength. A week later he increased it to 12. A month later to 18.



 ""I wanted to keep feeling the effect from when I first started,"" Chubb said.



 Darsow said Chubb's description is typical of a smoker who gradually develops a
nicotine tolerance. To maintain the euphoric effect, smokers increase the number
of cigarettes they smoke to intensify the levels of nicotine. With electronic
devices, vapers increase the nicotine strength level in the juice.



 ""After a while I started smoking cigarettes because vaping wasn't enough,""
Chubb said.



 He was back to where he was before he joined the Army.



 ==============================



 Electronic nicotine devices, or e-cigarettes, are marketed as healthy
alternatives to smoking, Darsow said.



 Advertisements for e-cigarettes report they are free from chemicals that cause
cancer and other respiratory diseases.



 ""E-cigarette ads are also attracting a younger population,"" Darsow said.
""YouTube commercials for e-cigarettes show attractive people promoting the
latest features. Their message is that vaping is glamorous, independent, and
high tech. And this appeals to youth.""



 Darsow said he doubts that vape juice flavors like cotton candy and chocolate
are targeted to adults.



 ""It's no accident that e-cigarette use among youth is increasing,"" Darsow said.
""It's very easy for students to vape in schools without teachers suspecting a
thing. Vaping leaves no smell behind.""



 Data from the Center for Disease Control indicates that e-cigarette use among
middle and high school students tripled from 2013 to 2014.



 The upward trend among youth usage is a serious public health problem, Darsow
said.



 ""We don't want our kids experimenting with vaping. Nicotine exposure at an
early age permanently alters neuro-receptors in the brain that then manifest
into an addiction,"" said Darsow.



 Currently e-cigarettes are not officially deemed tobacco products by the
federal government. That means there is little regulation on the marketing of
e-cigarettes, Darsow said.



 In November, the Kansas City metro area adopted ordinances raising the legal
age to purchase cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and related products to 21. But in
spite of these local and regional movements to curb sales among youth,
e-cigarettes are not subject to the same marketing restrictions as traditional
cigarettes.



 ""E-cigarettes are the perfect machine luring a new generation of young people
to lifelong nicotine dependence. We as a community must be vigiliant to protect
our youth through education while policies and regulations catch up,"" Darsow
said.

Vapers prepare for city-wide electronic cigarette ban starting Monday

BYLINE: By Aaron Martinez / El Paso Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1555 words","


Vapers, those people who use e-cigarettes to give them the sensation and
satisfaction of smoking cigarettes without the smoke or stink, are preparing for
a citywide ban on the popular devices.

They say they are being discriminated against and are being lumped in unfairly
with cigarette smokers.

The ban on the devices begins Monday.

""I don't think it is cool to put us with the smokers because all of us (vapers)
fought for a long time to get away from smoking and now they are classifying us
as the same,"" said Jake Etter, east side location store manager of Up In Vapor.
""A lot of vapers have used e-cigs to help quit and to group them with regular
smokers is just not right.""

Starting Monday, e-cigarette smokers will have to follow the same rules that
were put in place in 2002 to prohibit conventional smokers from lighting up in
public and at their workplaces.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that look like pens, pipes or
traditional cigarettes, and heat a flavored liquid that contains nicotine and
allows users to exhale vapor. E-cigarette devices, which usually range in price
from $40 to $80, hold about 2 milliliters of liquid. The liquid usually lasts
between a day to three days, depending on how much the vaper uses the device.

The new ordinance, passed by the El Paso City Council in June, bans all
e-cigarettes or related devices that allow users to inhale smoke or vapor
everywhere smoking is currently prohibited. The ordinance also bans smoking and
vaping within 20 feet of all entrances of enclosed public places.

""No I don't (think e-cigarettes are as dangerous as regular cigarettes), but you
are breathing things into your lungs that you are not supposed to have going
into your lungs,"" said city Rep. Michiel Noe, a doctor who voted in favor of the
ordinance. ""I don't think that e-cigs should be allowed in public because it
doesn't belong in your lungs and it is putting in particulate matter in the air
for other people to breath without their consent.""

Fines for violating the new ordinance range from $100 to $500.

""We applaud all those in the community who spent countless hours working to make
these changes to our local ordinance a reality,"" Department of Public Health
Director Robert Resendes said in a statement. ""We acknowledge that it was
ultimately the city council which took a brave stance on this quality of life
issue, and we thank them for that.""

As far as concerns of grouping vapers with cigarette smokers, Noe said while the
two are different, they do have similar effects.

""It is a different entity, but as far as regulation, yes (they should be grouped
together) because it is putting something in the air,"" Noe said. ""It has no
benefit whatsoever. Everybody says things like, 'So do cars, so are we going to
make cars illegal?' We would shut down the nation's economy if we did that. So
if you can show a benefit, fine tell me. OK, it cures cancer or it stops people
from smoking, but that's not true; there are other ways of doing that. None of
that has been proven true.""

One of the key arguments pro-vapors made to City Council was that the
e-cigarette have helped many traditional smokers quit or dramatically cut down
on the number cigarettes they are smoking.

Antonio Thomas, who used to be a chain smoker, said he is a great example of how
using e-cigarettes helped him quit smoking. Since he started vaping six months
ago, Thomas has gone from smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day to none.

""I was a heavy smoker and I would wake up in the middle of the night wanting a
cigarette and always had a craving for a cigarette,"" Thomas said. ""I needed to
quit. I just needed to quit cigarettes. I tried quitting in the past and failed.
I heard about vaping and e-cigarette, so I tried this and I haven't had a
cigarette since I started.""

Thomas said that he noticed immediate health benefits when he made the switch to
e-cigarettes.

""When I smoked, I would be wheezing all the time, it was harder for me to breath
and when I would go up and down stairs, I could feel it in my lungs and it was
just harder to breath,"" Thomas said. ""Since I started vaping, I can breath a lot
easier and I don't wake up in the middle of the night wanting to vape like I did
with cigarettes.""

On the other side of the debate, health experts and anti-vaping advocates say
the effects vaping has on a person's health have not been fully tested and using
them to quit smoking creates more of a health risk then proven quitting methods
such as nicotine gum and patches.

Ted Cooper, principal investigator for the Smoke Free Paso Del Norte foundation,
said one of the reasons why using nicotine gum or other conventional
stop-smoking aids are better is due to the government regulating the products.
E-cigarettes are still not strongly regulated and the nicotine levels in each
device, depending on the brand, varies, Cooper said.

""Cigarettes are really bad, and cancer causing, and the leading cause of death
and disease in the United States. They (e-cigarettes) may or may not be less
carcinogenetic; the data is not there,"" Cooper said. ""An adult who's trying to
use this, in some way, as a cessation device really doesn't know, like with a
patch or a gum or a lozenge, what level of nicotine he or she is using. If one
is trying to quit and you are using more nicotine, that is not going to help.
That's going to hurt.""

Now that the ordinance is going into effect, Thomas said he is worried about how
having to go outside to vape around smokers will affect his health.

""In a way, I don't think it is fair because they are putting us in the same
section with regular smokers, and I know for a fact that secondhand smoke is
more dangerous than vaping,"" Thomas said. ""Instead of going to where the regular
smokers are, I guess I'm going to go try to make a section for myself. Yeah, I
am concerned (about having to vape near regular smokers). That is a bigger
concern now that I don't smoke. There are more chemicals in a cigarette than
there is in vaping, a lot more.""

The ordinance will go into effect in three phases, officials said.

Phase one, which starts Monday, will ban e-cigarette and related devices from
public and work spaces. This phase will also prohibit vaping and smoking within
20 feet of entrances to public places.

Phase two, which will go into effect Jan. 1, bans vaping at all city-owned
indoor and outdoor facilities, including stadiums, parks and playgrounds.

""It is important to ban e-cigarettes from public places, especially parks,"" said
Nora Hernandez, program manager for the Smoke Free Paso Del Norte foundation.
""E-cigarettes are still new and there isn't enough data to say what the health
effects are of the vapor from e-cigarettes. The effects of secondhand vapor
isn't known yet. It is better to err on the side of caution. I don't want my
children breathing in what electronic cigarettes release.""

One of the few studies published on the secondhand effects of e-cigarettes found
they are safer than regular cigarettes, but still release dangerous toxins. The
study, ""Second-Hand E-Cigarette Smoke: Healthier Than Regular Cigarette Smoke,
but Still Contains Some Toxic Elements,"" was conducted by University of Southern
California Professor Constantinos Sioutas.

""Our results demonstrate that overall electronic cigarettes seem to be less
harmful than regular cigarettes, but their elevated content of toxic metals such
as nickel and chromium do raise concerns,"" Sioutas said in a statement.

Secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes does not release the same ""cancer-causing""
toxins that cigarettes release, the study found.

""While tobacco smoke contains high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
cancer-causing organic compounds   the level of exposure to these substances was
reduced to almost zero in second-hand e-cigarette smoke, due to the fact that
they do not burn organic material the way old-fashioned cigarettes do,"" the
study reported.

The third phase, which will go into effect July 1, will require all smoke shops,
including vaping businesses, to place isolated venting and air controls in their
businesses to keep the vapor or smoke from going into other nearby businesses.
The last phase will have a big impact on vaping businesses, Etter said.

""Once the ban goes into effect, vaping shops and other establishments have some
time to get within the ban limitations, so it kind of helps us since we are
already thinking about expanding,"" Etter said. ""But now we have to look at other
locations, because to section off the ventilation here at this location would
just be too expensive.""

While it will cost his store a lot of money to meet the requirements, overall
Etters does not believe the vaping ban will have a big impact on his business.
Etters did not have exact figures on how many customers his shop sees on
average, but he said business has increased in the past few weeks.

""At first I thought it was going to affect us a lot,"" Etters said. ""But ever
since City Council, our sales have gone way up. So it doesn't seem like it will
affect our business too much. The meeting on banning vaping seems to have
brought more attention to vaping, so while the ban is affecting vapers, it seems
to actually be helping us with business.""

A1 Vapors Announces Engagement Agreement with FSC Company

LENGTH: 554  words","


Jan. 22 -- US-based A1 Group issued the following news release:

A1 Vapors (A1 Group, Inc.) (OTCQB: AWON) announced today that it has entered
into an engagement agreement with FSC Company, a specialty consulting firm that
develops marketing strategies for emerging markets -- such as the
technologically centric Vaping business. The Vaping Retail Market is frequently
referred to as the e-cigarette business, which according to Wells Fargo Equity
Research in March of 2014, has grown to $4-billion, or 5% of the tobacco market.
Wells Fargo Securities analyst, Bonnie Herzog, states, "" in 10 years, vapers
will outnumber smokers.""

Although the competing tobacco cigarette industry is estimated to be over
$80-billion, volume sales reached their lowest level since 2004 last year with
just 47.5 billion units sold. Comparatively, the e-cigarette market has grown at
a double digit rate over the last five years, and according to Wells Fargo,
sales are expected to increase five-fold by 2017. This is a market with
increasingly widespread appeal.

As Los Angeles Times reporter, Robin Abcarian, wrote in her article on December
5, 2014, ""Last month, Oxford Dictionaries lexicographers announced they'd chosen
'vape' as 2014's word of the year."" She continued, ""Despite the fact that the
vaping industry is estimated to be a $4-billion business in the U.S., it has the
feel of a slightly underground, countercultural enterprise. Advocates say this
is because vaping is a grass-roots, consumer-driven phenomenon that has not been
co-opted (yet) by major tobacco companies.""

A1 Vapors, a Vapor retailer with locations in Florida, recognizes that the
Vaping industry's success will bring increased competition, not only from
emerging entrepreneurs, but from the other five cigarette manufacturers who have
not yet committed to an e-cigarette marketing position, specifically, Brown &
Williamson, Commonwealth Brands, Liggett, Philip Morris, and R.J. Reynolds. In
April of 2012, Lorillard, the nation's oldest continuously operating tobacco
business, acquired an electronic cigarette company called ""blu eCigs"" for
$135-million.

Bruce Storrs, A1 Vapors' CEO, said, ""We see the vaping business beginning to
reach new maturity levels in product offerings and marketing positions. We need
the help of an innovative consulting firm like FSC Company to help us look at
all of our marketing and branding options as we prepare for market shifts that
occur when everyone is enjoying sales success. We don't want to lose sight of
the greater perspectives as we work to scale operations. FSC will ensure that we
stay on the path of executing our business model and growth strategy.""

FSC Company Senior Advisor, Gil Figueroa, points out, ""Differentiation of
products and services in this industry has become difficult. Since the market is
driven by technology, health psychologies and social pressures -- like
restaurants, corporations and local communities reacting to anti-smoking
advocates -- new strategic views are necessary to navigate successful profit
routes. Our job"", he added, ""is to guide and support A1 Vapors, through their
endeavors in this nascent industry that many people don't quite understand yet.
We will provide a roadmap and a library of options that enable and equip them to
arrive successfully at their goals.""

Welsh e-cigarette ban will help push vapers to kick the habit;
BRITAIN'S BEST-LOVED HUSBAND AND WIFE TEAM REFLECT ON THE WEEK'S EVENTS EVERY
SATURDAY IN YOUR DAILY EXPRESS

BYLINE: Richard;Judy

SECTION: FEATURES; OPINION COLUMN; Pg. 18,19

LENGTH: 393 words","


JIN AN extraordinarily shortsighted move the Welsh government has banned smoking
e-cigarettes (or vaping) in enclosed public spaces.

All the evidence points to the fact that vaping does not kill, while smoking the
real thing certainly does. And the ban flies in the face of logic since the NHS
admits e-cigarettes are about 1,000 times less harmful than tobacco, and a
University College London study has found that vaping is a 60 per cent more
effective way to give up smoking than nicotine patches or gum.

I know something about living with a nicotine addict in the pre-vaping days. It
took Richard 10 years to give up smoking. He was seriously addicted and though
he tried again and again he always went back to it. I was often furious with him
because he'd swear he'd given up and then I'd catch him sneaking a crafty fag
behind my back.

Once I looked out of our bathroom window and saw him in the drive, puffing away.
I thundered downstairs by which time he knew I'd clocked him and had thrown the
cig away. When I confronted him he simply denied it although the offending butt
was lying on the driveway still glowing fiercely. That's the power of addiction:
total denial.

A lot of our rows in our early married life were about his secret smoking but he
didn't manage to quit completely until he got a real shock.

We interviewed the late John Diamond on This Morning. He was a talented writer
and broadcaster who developed cancer of the mouth. By the time we met him he'd
had surgery to remove part of his tongue. Miraculously he could still just about
speak but it was hard to understand him and he dribbled continuously.

This very brave man had written a book about his cancer in which he freely
acknowledged that the disease (which he knew would soon kill him) was caused by
his cigarette habit.

After the interview Richard went back to his dressing room, pulled out his
secret stash of fags from the wardrobe and threw them away. He never smoked
again.

Seeing at first-hand how my husband struggled to quit has made me welcome
e-cigarettes as life savers. Richard's father died young of a smoking-related
heart attack. Now my son smokes. When I see him with an e-cigarette I breathe a
sigh of relief.

One in five adults in the UK are addicted to nicotine. The Welsh ban won't do
Welsh smokers any favours. In fact it may well be pushing them into early
graves.

Vape cafe opens for e-cig users in Spartanburg

Aug. 01--Two local entrepreneurs hope to provide a new experience for vaping
enthusiasts in Spartanburg.

Susan and Billy Hedden will open The Vape Cafe on Saturday at 912 E. Main St. in
a 1,400-square-foot space at the strip center beside Willy Taco.

""We are so excited to see our concept reach fruition,"" Susan Hedden said. ""We
looked at what other vaping stores in the area were doing and said, 'How can we
take it a step further?' We hope this will be a destination, a hangout for the
local vaping community that is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds.""

A pool table, dart board and food counter selling coffee, hot dogs, nachos,
popcorn, slushies, donuts, ice cream, desserts and other goodies will greet
customers when they enter the store.

About a half-dozen tables surrounded by chairs and a row of bar stools at the
food counter provide comfortable seating for patrons. The store offers free
Wi-Fi and cable via two flat-screen TVs.

A large area in the center of the store houses the core of The Vape Cafe's
business--its wide selection of vaping devices, accessories and E-juices, the
liquids used in electronic cigarettes (or e-cigs).

""We've tried to create the best environment possible for our customers to be
able to come in and enjoy themselves and develop camaraderie with other vapers,""
Billy Hedden said.

The Heddens celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary this year. They have owned
and operated Mirror's Nightlife off South Blackstock Road since 2003.

""I'm a people person,"" Susan Hedden said. ""I love people.""

""I'm a little quiet,"" Billy Hedden said. ""But I open up more as I get to know
you... The main thing we both strive for is great customer service. I mean, if
you don't take care of your customers, you won't be in business very long.""

The owners said the driving force behind their business model is a desire to
help others quit smoking. They were able to mostly kick the habit a year ago
when they started vaping.

Vaping is the process by which a liquid made of propylene glycol or vegetable
glycerin and mixed with small amounts of nicotine and food grade flavorings are
""vaporized"" in a battery-powered atomizer.

E-cigs are the devices that simulate the experience of smoking and deliver doses
of nicotine to the user in an aerosol, range in size and efficiency.

""Vaping has turned into a very social activity,"" Susan Hedden said. ""There is a
huge online community of vapers in the Upstate... People like to talk about
modifications they've made. It's a bit like souping up a hot rod.""

The Heddens have hired Phillip ""Don Marvel"" Southard to manage the vaping side
of the business.

Southard said the store will feature a range of products catering to beginners
and experts.

It will have a wide selection of regular and premium E-juices that are made in
the store from four ingredients--propylene glycol mixed with flavoring and
vegetable glycerin mixed with nicotine. The strengths sold will range from 0 to
24 milligrams of nicotine. The store will sell a 10 milliliter bottle of regular
E-juice for $5.50 and a 30 milliliter bottle for $16.

The owners said the store has created four jobs so far, and they plan to
continue hiring.

The Vape Cafe will be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and
noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday.

A grand opening celebration will be held Saturday at the store. The festivities
will start at 1 p.m. They will include free food and drink, door prizes, a
""Cloud Competition,"" door prize giveaways and special deals on merchandise.

The owners said the smoking of cigarettes and other tobacco products are not
permitted in the building. Only customers who are 18 years old or older can
purchase vaping products and supplies.

Vaping on rise among Clark County teens

BYLINE: Marissa Harshman Columbian staff writer

SECTION: NORTH COUNTY; Pg. NC3

LENGTH: 719 words","



Nearly a quarter of high school seniors in Clark County are using electronic
cigarettes and other vaping devices - more than any other nicotine delivery
method, according to the recently released 2014 Healthy Youth Survey.The survey
revealed a significant increase in e-cigarette use among teens in Clark County
and across the state in the past two years. Meanwhile, Clark County teens'
marijuana use remained steady - although their perceived risk of marijuana use
dropped - and youth drinking declined.The Healthy Youth Survey is administered
statewide every two years to students in sixth, eighth, 10th and 12th grades.
Survey answers are voluntary and anonymous.

The October 2014 survey results were released Thursday.In 2014, 24 percent of
high school seniors said they had used e-cigarettes or vape pens in the
previous 30 days. In 2012, just 5 percent of seniors said they had recently
used e-cigarettes (the 2012 survey question did not include vape pens). Seniors
used e-cigarettes more often than cigarettes, cigars, candy-flavored tobacco,
hookah and smokeless tobacco.The increase in e-cigarette use was similar among
10th-graders (from 4 percent in 2012 to 21 percent in 2014) and eighth-graders
(from 2 percent in 2012 to 10 percent in 2014).The popularity of vaping devices
among youth of all ages is higher in Clark County than the statewide rate:
about 21 percent in Clark County compared to 18 percent statewide. In 2012, 4
percent of Clark County youth said they used e-cigarettes.""It's very alarming,""
said Theresa Cross, health educator for Clark County Public Health's chronic
disease prevention program. ""Vaping is becoming more popular.   Young people
are very aware that smoking isn't good for your health, but vaping doesn't have
that same impression.""They're becoming just as addicted to nicotine (through
vaping) as they would with these other products,"" she added.
Marijuana risks
Marijuana use among Clark County teens remained steady from 2012 to 2014, but
fewer teens reported that they think there are risks to using the drug.The
majority of high school students (70 percent of seniors and 60 percent of
10th-graders) said there was no risk or little risk to trying marijuana once or
twice, according to the 2014 survey. In 2014, about 46 percent of seniors said
there was no risk or little risk to regularly using marijuana (once or twice
per week) - up from 36 percent in 2010, according to the survey.The 2014 survey
also asked students about their habits regarding marijuana use and
driving.Nearly 18 percent of Clark County youth and 19 percent of youth
statewide said they have ridden in a car driven by someone who had been using
marijuana. About 17 percent of Clark County seniors said they have driven a car
within three hours of using marijuana.""We've got to ring the alarm bell,
because teens are telling us in their own terms that they don't consider
marijuana use to be risky and because they're being duped to start 'vaping,' ""
said Secretary of Health John Wiesman in a news release. ""We've got to take the
lessons learned about tactics that helped curb tobacco and alcohol use, and put
them to good use educating our kids about risks of using other substances.""
Alcohol
Youth alcohol consumption continued its downward trend in Clark County,
according to the report.In 2014, 34 percent of seniors, 20 percent of
10th-graders and 9 percent of eighth-graders said they had drunk alcohol in the
previous 30 days. In 2012, 36 percent of seniors, 23 percent of 10th-graders
and 11 percent of eighth-graders were drinking alcohol in the same time period,
according to the survey.In 2014, about a quarter of high school seniors
reported binge drinking, or drinking three or more days in the previous month,
and 9 percent reported driving after drinking alcohol. Eighteen percent said
they rode with a driver who had been drinking. Those rates were nearly the same
in 2012.""It underscores the need for continued public health and public
education of the danger of these products for young people,"" Cross said. ""We
take our attention away, or our foot off the hose, and the use, the problems
don't go away.""

A dynamic duo sets its sights on vaping

HIGHLIGHT: (Those who'd regulate behavior and those who'd profit from doing so.)



I quit smoking (again) last winter. I'm confident this will be the last time.
And among the pleasures of liberation is feeling a new freedom to sound off on
behalf of fellow nicotine junkies - a (happily) dwindling minority who are not
only persecuted, maligned and exploited, but frequently reminded that it's all
for their own good.

Fact is, taken as a whole, the anti-smoking public health movement of the past
half-century has done considerable good. But like any crusade fueled partly by
self-righteousness, it's always at some risk of being hijacked to serve more
selfish ends and of simply going too far.

Consider, for example, its largely hostile reaction to e-cigarettes.

On his ""Conversable Economist"" blog, Macalester's Timothy Taylor recently warned
of a ""Bootlegger/Baptist coalition"" that is threatening to snuff out the
potential of ""vaping"" to help smokers find a less harmful alternative to
traditional cigarettes.

Citing a recent paper on the issue by Jonathan Adler and others in ""Regulation""
magazine, Taylor explains that a ""bootlegger/baptist coalition"" can become a
powerful force whenever people who long to restrict a harmful thing (alcohol,
say, or gambling, or smoking) make common cause with others who are profiting
handsomely by peddling that harmful thing and are therefore eager to stiff-arm
any competition.

The only American more enraptured by Prohibition than Billy Sunday was Al
Capone.

The potential benefits or harms of vaping are still being studied. Questions
concern its physical effects as well as whether it mainly helps people quit
smoking or mainly helps create new nicotine addicts. (It played no role for me.)

The evidence so far seems encouraging that most vapers are current or former
smokers and that vaping is at least safer than smoking.

While opponents like to emphasize the unknowns, one thing is certain about
e-cigs: They are a threat to the profits flowing from the traditional nicotine
economy.

And the ""bootleggers"" enjoying those profits are more numerous and varied than
you might think. Potent ulterior motives may exist to burden e-cigarettes with
regulations and taxes.

The most obvious nicotine bootleggers are of course the big tobacco companies.
They have jumped into the e-cig business themselves, mainly with ""closed"" vaping
systems that mimic old-fashioned cigarettes. More tellingly, they are also
lobbying for e-cigarettes to be regulated similarly to tobacco products.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue rules later this
month that could, if sufficiently strict, stunt the rapidly evolving vaping
marketplace, especially the smaller makers of ""open,"" pipe-like vaping systems
that can be used with a variety of vaping liquids.

Devotion to safeguarding public health may not be Big Tobacco's only motive for
supporting heavy e-cig regulation. And some big drug companies, makers of other
""nicotine replacement"" products such a patches or gum, are likewise pushing
e-cig regulation, according to the report in ""Regulation.""

Meanwhile, there is another gang of nicotine ""bootleggers"" whose smoke screen of
good intentions may be a bit harder to see through. That would be state
governments, which almost two decades ago now cut deals with Big Tobacco to
share handsomely in its profits from exploiting smokers' thraldom.

That partnership came about through settlements of state lawsuits against the
tobacco firms. The various agreements provided large perpetual annual payments
to states in exchange for laws that protected the tobacco companies from
competition, ensuring that they could jack up prices and make smokers pay the
bill.

Both the tobacco firms and the states have done just fine under this
arrangement. Like many states, Minnesota cashed in its tobacco settlement,
selling bonds backed by the ongoing settlement payments. It used the proceeds to
help resolve a budget crisis in 2011.

But Minnesota couldn't quite kick its tobacco-loot habit. Just two years later,
the state imposed a $1.60-per-pack increase in its cigarette tax, giving
Minnesota one of the nation's highest rates in one of the most regressive of
taxes.

Defenders of the lawsuit settlements, and of punishing tobacco taxes, like to
claim that lofty cigarette prices help reduce smoking rates. The evidence is
mixed.

Adult smoking rates in America, which recently reached record lows, have
declined gradually and steadily ever since the Surgeon General's famous warning
about smoking's hazards 51 years ago. That decline hasn't accelerated since
prices started soaring. Youth smoking rates, on the other hand, have dropped
sharply in recent years.

Anyway, so long as states have a pecuniary interest in the sale of cigarettes,
their motives may be complicated when it comes to regulating and taxing e-cigs,
which are increasingly cutting into those sales. Minnesota is today one of only
two states that tax e-cigarettes.

In this year's legislative session, a bill was proposed to change the way
Minnesota taxes e-cigs. Spokesmen for vaping consumers and retailers say it
would have severely increased taxes on the ""open"" systems that are the main
challenge to Big Tobacco. It didn't pass, but proponents will doubtless try
again.

Some regulation and taxation of e-cigarettes makes sense. But while it isn't yet
clear how much of a benefit the vaping trend can be to smokers, keep an eye on
those out to crush it before we have a chance to find out.

Most companies putting a ban on e-cigarettes;
Device has shown to |also contain harmful cancer-causing chemicals

BYLINE:  Workplace Staff

SECTION: WORKPLACE; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 452 words","


While cigarettes were blacklisted as a social misdemeanour years ago, the modern
smoker's electronic cigarette devices are now stirring the same debate around
the office water cooler.

Last year, a World Health Organisation (WHO) report called for a ban on the use
of e-cigarettes in the workplace and with growing numbers of users, human
resource departments should be urgently developing policy around the devices,
says Dr Lerato Motshudi, medical adviser at Alexander Forbes Health.

Motshudi's call came just after the WHO World No Tobacco Day was marked on
Sunday, May 31.

In South Africa, while one can light up an e-cigarette in a restaurant or mall
depending on the decision of the owner of the space, workplaces are increasingly
banning them. ""E-cigarettes, which have been in use for the past decade, heat a
solution of nicotine and flavourings to form a vapour (coining the description '
vaping'), producing a similar effect to tobacco.""

Leading provider of financial and risk services, Alexander Forbes, has banned
vaping inside their offices.

""It is in the interests of employers and businesses to promote the health and
well-being of their employees and customers,"" says Motshudi.

""There are e-cigarettes that do contain nicotine in small doses and those that
have it in 'negligible' amounts. They also contain chemicals and substances that
can be cancer-causing.

""We are unable to police which devices people are using and if that particular
device does contain nicotine. Thus, when creating workplace policies, we focus
on the interest of all employees and based on this, Alexander Forbes chose to
forbid vaping inside our offices,"" said Motshudi.

The major concerns regarding vaping are that the products release cancer-causing
formaldehyde agents and some also contain nicotine.

""Employers then need to communicate their position firmly, in the form of a
written policy, to staff, and also with signage to alert any customers visiting
the premises that the use of e-cigarettes is not permitted inside the building.""

Motshudi said vaping areas, much like a designated smoking area, could be
created in situations where it was difficult to access an outside area.

""The policy should include an explanation on why the company has adopted the
position it has, including a summary of current medical evidence.

""It should also state who the policy is applicable to and where e-cigarette use
will be allowed as well as detail any penalties for those who do not comply with
the rule.""

Motshudi believes that if a company has a well-communicated guideline on vaping
it could ""assist in improving employees' knowledge about smoking, and provide an
opportunity to direct staff to services which assist them to stop smoking"".

E-cig use restricted in Senate measure

BYLINE: ABBY SIMONS; STAFF WRITER, STAR TRIBUNE (Mpls.-St. Paul)

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 563 words","



HIGHLIGHT: The bill places the activity known as ""vaping"" under the state's
Clean Indoor Air Act.


The Minnesota Senate voted Thursday to bring the use of electronic cigarettes -
known as ""vaping"" - under the same public space restrictions that apply to
tobacco.

The bill now heads for a showdown with a less restrictive House version passed
earlier this week that would ban vaping only at state buildings and public
schools. While support for banning the sale of the devices to minors has
garnered near-universal support, lawmakers are divided on whether to ban indoor
use when the effects of vaping are still being studied.

""I'm going to work very hard to make certain that the bill stays whole,"" said
the measure's sponsor, Sen. Kathy Sheran, DFL-Mankato, moments after the
proposal passed 48-17 as part of the Senate's Health and Human Services Omnibus
bill. Sheran noted that despite earlier reservations, Gov. Mark Dayton has
agreed to sign the bill if it arrives at his desk.

""I've been successful in the Senate in persuading my colleagues to support this
and I hope to now carry that over and persuade the House,"" she said.

The debate surrounding state regulation of electronic cigarettes is likely to be
watched closely as a primer on how to handle a booming industry with a still
somewhat mysterious product.

In the past year, 80 percent of Minnesota's 200 e-cigarette retailers have set
up shop in kiosks and brick-and-mortar stores, garnering gratitude from users
who say the devices are a safe alternative for those trying to quit smoking. But
the devices, which can contain nicotine laced with various flavors that emit a
vapor rather than smoke, concern some who say little is known about what
chemicals secondhand vapors contain, and whether they're harmful.

""Six months ago most people didn't know what an e-cigarette was,"" said Rep.
Laurie Halverson, DFL-Eagan, the House bill's sponsor. Halvorson removed the
Senate language from her bill that would have placed e-cigarettes under the
state's Clean Indoor Air Act, as a way to gain votes. Her version passed 86-46
as part of the House Health and Human Services Omnibus bill.

Halverson said she has seen a shift, with lawmakers changing their minds on the
devices they once considered benign.

""I've had people who have gone from 'I think these [devices] are a good idea' to
'I'm with you 100 percent,' "" she said.

However, on the Senate floor Thursday, opponents of the measure maintained that
there is no research proving that secondhand vapors are harmful.

""At least with smoking you can argue there is a demonstrable secondary impact,
that it hurts people,"" said Sen. Sean Nienow, R-Cambridge. ""There is nothing
anybody can point to that this electronic cigarette vapor hurts the guy two
chairs down.""

""I'm not willing to wait until proof of harm on something,"" countered Sen. Vicki
Jensen, DFL-Owatonna. ""Let's wait for proof it's OK.""

The tobacco industry for decades fought any link between its product and cancer,
contending that the research was inconclusive.

Last month, the federal Food and Drug Administration proposed regulations
extending the agency's tobacco authority to e-cigarettes, warning that the
devices haven't been fully studied. Halverson said the FDA isn't the only
industry keeping a close eye on Minnesota's proceedings.

""We always pay attention when tobacco companies send lobbyists in from
Washington, D.C.,"" she said. ""You can certainly see this is a big investment.""

Vapers prepare for city-wide electronic cigarette ban starting Monday

BYLINE: Aaron Martinez, El Paso Times, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1582 words","


Aug. 31--Vapers, those people who use e-cigarettes to give them the sensation
and satisfaction of smoking cigarettes without the smoke or stink, are preparing
for a citywide ban on the popular devices.

They say they are being discriminated against and are being lumped in unfairly
with cigarette smokers.

The ban on the devices begins Monday.

""I don't think it is cool to put us with the smokers because all of us (vapers)
fought for a long time to get away from smoking and now they are classifying us
as the same,"" said Jake Etter, east side location store manager of Up In Vapor.
""A lot of vapers have used e-cigs to help quit and to group them with regular
smokers is just not right.""

Starting Monday, e-cigarette smokers will have to follow the same rules that
were put in place in 2002 to prohibit conventional smokers from lighting up in
public and at their workplaces.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that look like pens, pipes or
traditional cigarettes, and heat a flavored liquid that contains nicotine and
allows users to exhale vapor. E-cigarette devices, which usually range in price
from $40 to $80, hold about 2 milliliters of liquid. The liquid usually lasts
between a day to three days, depending on how much the vaper uses the device.

The new ordinance, passed by the El Paso City Council in June, bans all
e-cigarettes or related devices that allow users to inhale smoke or vapor
everywhere smoking is currently prohibited. The ordinance also bans smoking and
vaping within 20 feet of all entrances of enclosed public places.

""No I don't (think e-cigarettes are as dangerous as regular cigarettes), but you
are breathing things into your lungs that you are not supposed to have going
into your lungs,"" said city Rep. Michiel Noe, a doctor who voted in favor of the
ordinance. ""I don't think that e-cigs should be allowed in public because it
doesn't belong in your lungs and it is putting in particulate matter in the air
for other people to breath without their consent.""

Fines for violating the new ordinance range from $100 to $500.

""We applaud all those in the community who spent countless hours working to make
these changes to our local ordinance a reality,"" Department of Public Health
Director Robert Resendes said in a statement. ""We acknowledge that it was
ultimately the city council which took a brave stance on this quality of life
issue, and we thank them for that.""

As far as concerns of grouping vapers with cigarette smokers, Noe said while the
two are different, they do have similar effects.

""It is a different entity, but as far as regulation, yes (they should be grouped
together) because it is putting something in the air,"" Noe said. ""It has no
benefit whatsoever. Everybody says things like, 'So do cars, so are we going to
make cars illegal?' We would shut down the nation's economy if we did that. So
if you can show a benefit, fine tell me. OK, it cures cancer or it stops people
from smoking, but that's not true; there are other ways of doing that. None of
that has been proven true.""

One of the key arguments pro-vapors made to City Council was that the
e-cigarette have helped many traditional smokers quit or dramatically cut down
on the number cigarettes they are smoking.

Antonio Thomas, who used to be a chain smoker, said he is a great example of how
using e-cigarettes helped him quit smoking. Since he started vaping six months
ago, Thomas has gone from smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day to none.

""I was a heavy smoker and I would wake up in the middle of the night wanting a
cigarette and always had a craving for a cigarette,"" Thomas said. ""I needed to
quit. I just needed to quit cigarettes. I tried quitting in the past and failed.
I heard about vaping and e-cigarette, so I tried this and I haven't had a
cigarette since I started.""

Thomas said that he noticed immediate health benefits when he made the switch to
e-cigarettes.

""When I smoked, I would be wheezing all the time, it was harder for me to breath
and when I would go up and down stairs, I could feel it in my lungs and it was
just harder to breath,"" Thomas said. ""Since I started vaping, I can breath a lot
easier and I don't wake up in the middle of the night wanting to vape like I did
with cigarettes.""

On the other side of the debate, health experts and anti-vaping advocates say
the effects vaping has on a person's health have not been fully tested and using
them to quit smoking creates more of a health risk then proven quitting methods
such as nicotine gum and patches.

Ted Cooper, principal investigator for the Smoke Free Paso Del Norte foundation,
said one of the reasons why using nicotine gum or other conventional
stop-smoking aids are better is due to the government regulating the products.
E-cigarettes are still not strongly regulated and the nicotine levels in each
device, depending on the brand, varies, Cooper said.

""Cigarettes are really bad, and cancer causing, and the leading cause of death
and disease in the United States. They (e-cigarettes) may or may not be less
carcinogenetic; the data is not there,"" Cooper said. ""An adult who's trying to
use this, in some way, as a cessation device really doesn't know, like with a
patch or a gum or a lozenge, what level of nicotine he or she is using. If one
is trying to quit and you are using more nicotine, that is not going to help.
That's going to hurt.""

Now that the ordinance is going into effect, Thomas said he is worried about how
having to go outside to vape around smokers will affect his health.

""In a way, I don't think it is fair because they are putting us in the same
section with regular smokers, and I know for a fact that secondhand smoke is
more dangerous than vaping,"" Thomas said. ""Instead of going to where the regular
smokers are, I guess I'm going to go try to make a section for myself. Yeah, I
am concerned (about having to vape near regular smokers). That is a bigger
concern now that I don't smoke. There are more chemicals in a cigarette than
there is in vaping, a lot more.""

The ordinance will go into effect in three phases, officials said.

Phase one, which starts Monday, will ban e-cigarette and related devices from
public and work spaces. This phase will also prohibit vaping and smoking within
20 feet of entrances to public places.

Phase two, which will go into effect Jan. 1, bans vaping at all city-owned
indoor and outdoor facilities, including stadiums, parks and playgrounds.

""It is important to ban e-cigarettes from public places, especially parks,"" said
Nora Hernandez, program manager for the Smoke Free Paso Del Norte foundation.
""E-cigarettes are still new and there isn't enough data to say what the health
effects are of the vapor from e-cigarettes. The effects of secondhand vapor
isn't known yet. It is better to err on the side of caution. I don't want my
children breathing in what electronic cigarettes release.""

One of the few studies published on the secondhand effects of e-cigarettes found
they are safer than regular cigarettes, but still release dangerous toxins. The
study, ""Second-Hand E-Cigarette Smoke: Healthier Than Regular Cigarette Smoke,
but Still Contains Some Toxic Elements,"" was conducted by University of Southern
California Professor Constantinos Sioutas.

""Our results demonstrate that overall electronic cigarettes seem to be less
harmful than regular cigarettes, but their elevated content of toxic metals such
as nickel and chromium do raise concerns,"" Sioutas said in a statement.

Secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes does not release the same ""cancer-causing""
toxins that cigarettes release, the study found.

""While tobacco smoke contains high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons --
cancer-causing organic compounds -- the level of exposure to these substances
was reduced to almost zero in second-hand e-cigarette smoke, due to the fact
that they do not burn organic material the way old-fashioned cigarettes do,"" the
study reported.

The third phase, which will go into effect July 1, will require all smoke shops,
including vaping businesses, to place isolated venting and air controls in their
businesses to keep the vapor or smoke from going into other nearby businesses.
The last phase will have a big impact on vaping businesses, Etter said.

""Once the ban goes into effect, vaping shops and other establishments have some
time to get within the ban limitations, so it kind of helps us since we are
already thinking about expanding,"" Etter said. ""But now we have to look at other
locations, because to section off the ventilation here at this location would
just be too expensive.""

While it will cost his store a lot of money to meet the requirements, overall
Etters does not believe the vaping ban will have a big impact on his business.
Etters did not have exact figures on how many customers his shop sees on
average, but he said business has increased in the past few weeks.

""At first I thought it was going to affect us a lot,"" Etters said. ""But ever
since City Council, our sales have gone way up. So it doesn't seem like it will
affect our business too much. The meeting on banning vaping seems to have
brought more attention to vaping, so while the ban is affecting vapers, it seems
to actually be helping us with business.""

Smokers wanting to kick the habit into touch have always struggled because they
miss the act of smoking itself - something that sprays and patches can't
provide.

And that's where 'vaping' comes in. In short, it's smoking but without wrecking
your health.

Flavoured liquids are inserted into a battery-powered unit and inhaled, even
producing a steam vapour akin to exhaling after a drag on a cigarette.

Giannis Florentzidis has opened The Vapour Store on Carolgate in Retford and
wants to spread the word about the benefits of vaping.

As a former 20-a-day smoker of 24 years, Giannis discovered that e-cigarettes
gave him the satisfaction of smoking but now he doesn't worry about the amount
he spends or his health.

""Patches and sprays just didn't work for me because I missed having something to
do with my hands, the act of smoking,"" said the father-of-two.

""I started on vapour cigarettes in January last year and I found I could stop
immediately.""

He said a client of his, who only had 32% lung capacity when she visited
Giannis' Worksop store, saw that increase to 72% after giving up smoking and
starting vaping.

The cost of vaping is also a fraction of smoking - Giannis went from spending
nearly £200 a month as a smoker to under £20 as a vaper.

The Vapour Store offers beginner kits all the way through to advanced vaping
equipment and top advice on what is right for you.

A full range of flavours - from tobacco to fruity choices like strawberry and
pineapple - is in stock too.

Vape seen as a threat to tobacco firms

BYLINE: Kavithah Rakwan

SECTION: C - CENTRAL; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 550 words","


More people are jumping onto the vape bandwagon and this poses a threat to the
tobacco industry's lucrative business and could deny the government millions in
tax collection.

People in the vaping industry are convinced that the vaping culture is gaining
grounds among Malaysians, similar to what is happening in many countries.

""Malaysia is already a huge import market for vape products. Chinese suppliers
export about 30% of their vape related merchandises to the country,"" said Aimran
Abdul Rajak at Vape Empire, one of the largest vape distributors in the country.

Although there is no official figure on the number of vape users in Malaysia,
people in the industry estimates there are about 500,000 vape users presently.

Aimran said the increase in the number of vape users or e-cigarette is reflected
by its company own growth and demands.

""We have been experiencing booming business. Within two years, we have opened 45
outlets throughout Malaysia,"" he said.

Besides claims that vaping is healthier, it is a cheaper alternative to
cigarette.

""It is apparent that tobacco companies are seeing their revenue fall gradually
while the vape business is growing year-on-year.

""One reason for its popula- rity is that tobacco users are resorting to vaping
as a way to quit smoking,"" Aimran told The Malaysian Reserve.

While the cost of the vape starter kit could start from RM250 and a 30ml flavour
costs about RM40, it has not deterred many especially the youth from taking up
the habit. Research in the UK shows vaping cost 40% less than cigarette.

Vapers use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), or e-cigs to deliver a
vaporised mixture of chemicals when inhaled.

Each device has an electronic vaporisation system and controls, rechargeable
batteries, and cartridges, which contain varying amounts of liquid nicotine and
various flavours.

When puffed on, ENDS heat up the liquid, converting it to a vapour, which is
inhaled.

The Health Ministry, however, is concerned about the growing trend among
underage Malaysians and has expressed its intention to regulate the industry.

""Any sort of regulation will bring the industry to a better level. In 2014, the
European Parliament passed a bill and vaping was fully regulated.

""Since then, the industry has been growing there. So there are more pros and
cons when an industry is regulated,"" said Aimran.

British American Tobacco (M) Bhd saw a 3.7% decrease in its domestic and duty
free sales volume in 2014 compared to 2013 while contract manufacturing volumes
for export dropped 14.8% in 2014 from the previous year.

Alliance DBS Research Sdn Bhd's analyst Cheah King Yoong said in a research
report that the tobacco industry's prospects will be increasingly challenging as
the sector's landscape is being dragged by declining cigarette consumption per
capita due to increasingly health-conscious population and emergence of
alternative product offerings such as electronic cigarettes.

As cigarettes in Malaysia are heavily taxed, the shrinking in the sales would
mean lesser revenue for the government.

In 2011, the government collected tobacco related taxes amounting to US$1.6
billion (RM6.78 billion) according to the Customs department and Ministry of
Finance Data 2010-2012. Vape products presently are not taxed like tobacco
products.

Vaping versus smoking - the case for e-cigarettes

BYLINE: Suchitra Bajpai Chaudhary Senior Reporter

LENGTH: 1154 words","


Dubai: Many countries, including the UAE, have banned electronic cigarettes or
e-cigarettes but a worldwide survey of 19,441 users in 2014 found it had minimal
adverse effects (about 1/100th to 1/20th) compared with smoking. Those who
switched to vaping from smoking reported a reduction in harmful effects, with
very mild and temporary side effects.

The research findings, conducted by Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos, MD, Researcher
from the Onassis Cardiac Surgery Centre, Athens and from the University of
Patra, Greece, were published in the International Journal of Environmental
Research and Public Health last year.

Dr Farsalinos came out in support of vaping and told Gulf News: ""I believe that
you can help smokers use a less harmful alternative. The concerns about
e-cigarette use by youngsters and being a gateway to smoking are invalid because
a very small proportion of youngsters is using e-cigarettes (and the vast
majority of them are smokers, so it would be a good thing to try e-cigarettes
because they might quit smoking), while all studies are clearly showing that
e-cigarettes are the gateway âEUR[#x2dc]from' smoking, not âEUR[#x2dc]to'
smoking.""

Dr Farsalinos feels e-cigarettes are the best alternative for someone wanting to
quit smoking as it not only plays a role in reduction of harm but also addresses
the psycho-behavioural aspects of smoke dependence.

""E-cigarettes are a unique product in tobacco harm reduction because it
addresses both the chemical (through delivery of nicotine) and the
psycho-behavioural aspect of smoking dependence (by simulating smoking, using
the same movements, producing visible vapour which looks like smoke, providing
sensory stimulation). At the same time, there is no tobacco and no combustion.
Knowing that people smoke for nicotine but die from the combustion products, it
is obvious that e-cigarettes will result in a public health benefit by
substituting the experience perceived by smokers from smoking with the use of a
significantly less harmful product. Therefore, we urge politicians and
regulators to act immediately by asking experts to provide them with a balanced
and comprehensive overview of the currently available evidence, because all
decisions should be science-based and oriented towards public health benefit
rather than harm.""

Why the World Health Organisation (WHO) is not convinced?

The WHO remains unconvinced of the harm reduction aspect of e-smoking and thinks
youngsters who have had no experience of smoking might indirectly get hooked on
nicotine through vaping products if it approved e cigarettes. Therefore, it has
a clear stand about not endorsing it.

The WHO continues to remain cautious about e-cigarette sales as it feels the
product was introduced only in 2006 and the medical evidence on its long-term
harms is still inconclusive as research continues. It recommends the regulation
of e-cigarettes and refuses to give it an all clear.

At the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC COP6) held in 2014, parties emphasised
the fact that smokeless tobacco products posed a genuine and fast-growing public
health problem and they felt that smokeless products like e-cigarettes needed  a
regulation as strong as that on cigarettes and other tobacco products because
these were being endorsed by tobacco companies and made attractive to the
younger generation.

Why UAE continues with the ban on e-cigarettes

A UAE private doctor who has worked closely in the Ministry of Health's
anti-tobacco campaigns explained why the ministry would never allow the legal
sale of e-cigarettes: ""The main reason why UAE wants to support the tough stand
taken by the WHO against ENDS (Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems) is probably
because it is highly possible for a newcomer or a youngster to take up smoking.
Nicotine has a role in neuro-degeneration and there is evidence of brain
development problems in children and foetuses that have been exposed to
nicotine. It is highly addictive and we don't encourage the use of any form of
nicotine for those who have never smoked or for children and pregnant women, and
our report on e-cigarettes is consistent with this,"" he said.

What vapers say

In the meanwhile many e-cigarette users in Dubai and other countries narrated
their experience of how it helped them kick the habit.

In Dubai an expat who used to smoke between six-eight cigarettes switched to
vaping about six months ago and is delighted that he was able to drastically cut
down his smoking to about a couple of cigarettes in a month which he feels is a
clean experience that is not offensive to anyone else and gives a healthy option
to someone looking for harm reduction.

He feels if a person is determined to switch to vaping because he consciously
wants to quit smoking then the transition becomes easier. ""I had tried quitting
a couple of times but would revert. Now I seem to have hit the spot. By vaping I
don't miss the âEUR[#x2dc]exhaling' of ""smoke"" and its psychological hold over
me and thus 90 per cent of the battle is won. I don't believe I will be a slave
to a cigarette any moreâEUR¦.clearly not with a vape stick in my pocket,"" he
said.

Recounting the positive health benefits which he felt were tremendous he said:
""My breathing is back to normal, I have had a drastic reduction in phlegm and
issues of breathlessness. I wake up with âEUR[#x2dc]fresh breath', my clothes
don't smell of tobacco."" His advise to smokers looking to quit the vaping way
is: ""If you can't quit smoking or go cold turkey then switch to vaping, it will
help you a great deal. Like in most western countries vaping should be made
legal in the UAE including the right to advertise it. You can save the life and
health of a chronic smoker and sale of cigarettes will drop in a big way. Most
younger generation smokers in the West have now switched to vaping and cleaning
up. It is a big relief that I don't need to carry cigarettes and a lighter in my
pocket any more and do not feel enslaved. Gone are the days of going out in the
heat just to smoke a smelly cigarette and endure bad breath and heavy
breathing!""

Lou Ritter, 53, from USA, said, ""After 33 years smoking almost a pack of
cigarettes per day I quit completely by using electronic cigarettes. On the
first day when I used an electronic cigarette I smoked half as many tobacco
cigarettes and was weaned off tobacco completely in one month.  Physical
stamina, endurance and breathing improved almost immediately and continue to
improve. I feel stronger and healthier now than in my mid-thirties. I will never
smoke tobacco again. ""

Dimitris Manolas, 43, from Greece: ""After smoking for 22 years, I was surprised
to realise how easily I managed to quit smoking within 10 days after initiating
e-cigarette use. Within days I felt my sense of smell and taste coming back.
Right now, I cannot imagine myself going back to smoking. It would taste
horrible.""

VIDEO: New establishments offer safer solution to smoking, create social
atmosphere

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 474 words","


June 07--CHICKASHA -- A 2010 census from the Center of Disease Control and
Prevention found that 24.7 percent of the adult population in Oklahoma smokes.

The state ranks 47th in the nation, in regards to smoking mortality rates with
6,200 dying each year from smoking related diseases.

It's an epidemic in Oklahoma, but technological innovation and social ingenuity
have some residents fighting fire with different sort of flame.

E-cigerettes arrived on the scene in 2007, marketed as a healthy alternative to
smoking. and as of last week, two lounges touting the safety of vaping opened in
Chickasha.

Owner of The Vapor Lounge on 4th Street, Shawn Tran, said he has always enjoyed
vaping and when the opportunity to open a store presented itself, he took it.

""Vaping is a healthy alternative for people who smoke cigarettes,"" Tran said.
""All it is, is water vapor, nicotine and some flavoring.""

According to an article on howstuffworks.com, electronic cigarettes are designed
to look just like regular cigarettes, but with one major difference, you don't
need a match or lighter to use them.

The device holds a battery holds, a vaporization chamber and a cartridge filled
with liquid nicotine in order to satisfy cravings.

""The benefit of vaping over cigarettes, is you don't smoke the 5,000 chemicals
that come with cigarettes,"" Tran said.

Vaping isn't solely for smokers looking to kick the habit.

Tran said he has many customers who vape just for fun.

""There's a bunch of flavors like chocolate, strawberry and blueberry, so you can
mix it up,"" he said.

A typically cigarette has 24 milligrams of nicotine in it, said Tran ,who offers
products with nicotine amounts ranging from zero to the industry standard.

Respondents to a question on The Express-Star's Facebook on vaping varied.

""My husband started using these and quit,"" wrote Lyndi Wilkerson Douglass. ""I am
so happy that he started this, it's so much better than cigarettes, he's already
gotten some of his senses back he had lost, and he smells much better!""

Some were a little more wary of the new craze.

""Until we know for sure I still do not want to inhale this smoke! I agree it is
a better option and I support people choosing this option! Just not ready to see
open smoking of these yet,"" wrote Heather Cocheran Ford.

Others are convinced  the vapor has to be just as volatile to a person's health
as tobacco.

""Vapor is not safe,"" Gary Higgins wrote. ""You're breathing in sweet smelling
chemicals in your lungs. The data on this new trend isn't complete yet. Be
careful of this. It's not only water.""

Despite the criticism, Tran said he develops plans for costumers to move away
from tobacco use, with the aide vaping and will continue to do so.

Oregon: Board bans e-cig sales to minors, vaping indoors

LENGTH: 683  words","

DATELINE: Salem


Multnomah County of Oregon has issued the following news release:

The Multnomah County Commissioners today unanimously voted to restrict
e-cigarettes and vaping to protect children and public health.

In a 5-0 vote, the board passed an ordinance that prohibits minors from buying
and using inhalant delivery systems, such as e-cigs and vape pens. When the law
takes effect on April 5, businesses will be prohibited from selling the devices
to people under age 18. And vaping won't be allowed in workplaces where smoking
is prohibited.

""My primary concern is protecting kids from exposure to these products,'' Chair
Deborah Kafoury said at Thursday's meeting. ""And I want to ensure that people
who choose not to vape are protected at work.""

Since November, the county has held 11 public meetings on vaping and
e-cigarettes.

The products, which have emerged in the last eight years, are marketed as an
alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes. But there is little information
about their safety. The health effects of the vapor on users and those around
them is unknown. Until the board acted, children and teens could legally
purchase and use them in Multnomah County. A key component of electronic
cigarettes, vape pens and other inhalant delivery systems is nicotine - a highly
addictive and harmful substance for developing brains.

Since last fall, Health Department staff and Chair Kafoury met city councils in
Troutdale, Fairview, Wood Village and Portland. More than 300 comments were
gathered online about the proposed regulation.

On March 5, commissioners thanked dozens of people for testifying, but said they
had to act now.

""We're not stopping adults from vaping,'' said Commissioner Loretta Smith. ""You
can still buy and vape. But what we're concerned about is lots of dollars are
put into advertising e-cigarettes and it's becoming a gateway drug to tobacco.
We're trying to protect the children. We are not trying to take your rights away
as adults.''

""We do not want to create the next generation of nicotine addicts,'' said Chair
Kafoury.

Many of those who testified at the board meeting work at vape shops or
manufacture the liquids used in e-cigs. They asked that their businesses be
exempt from the new rules. They said the shops often serve as vaping lounges and
are an important gathering place for people to come together, sample flavors and
learn how to use the devices.

""Whether you like it or not, the vaping industry is here to stay,'' said James
Cook of Gresham. ""We're asking for an opportunity to get local businesses
involved. Bring us to the table. No one wants to vape in church or in the movie
theater. We're asking for one thing: to let our businesses live.''

""This is not an anti-jobs bill,'' said Commissioner Diane McKeel. ""This is about
public health.''

Other users described quitting tobacco after discovering e-cigarettes at vape
shops.

""They taught me about the juices and nicotine,'' said consumer Clifford Smith.
""They allow me to bike 10 miles, vape with my friends and continue to try
different e-liquids and buy new products.''

People who use e-cigarettes, own and work at vape shops, gather outside the
Multnomah Building before Thursday's board meeting.

Mel Rader, executive director of Upstream Public Health, said the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention have not approved e-cigarettes for tobacco
cessation. He said there is a ""clear history'' of kids starting with
e-cigarettes and moving to tobacco, and that sampling creates a threshold for
addictive products.

Q: Does smoking e-cigarettes fall under no smoking rules, regarding gas pumps? I
was filling my tank and the person next to me was filling their tank while
smoking an electronic cigarette. ---Jackie Graves, Grayson

A: There is ""no risk of fire"" while smoking an e-cigarette while filling up with
gas because ""there is no smoke or combustion involved,"" Gregory Conley,
president of the American Vaping Association, told Q&A on the News in an email.

""Unless a city, county or state has specifically amended their smoke-free air
law to include the use of vapor products, vaping is permitted,"" he wrote. ""In
the context of a gas station, we ban smoking for public safety ... . The same
justification isn't applicable to vaping.""

Chatham County, DeKalb County, Pooler and Savannah have passed laws banning
vaping where is smoking is banned, he wrote.

DATELINE: Norman


Norman County of Minnesota has issued the following news release:


For Minnesota's growing e-cigarette industry, the House omnibus tax bill looks
like a bust.

Buried in the bill is a provision that would change the way e-cigarettes are
taxed. Right now, disposable e-cigarettes or vapor used in reusable e-cigarettes
is taxed at 95 percent of the wholesale price of tobacco products.

The tax bill would change the rules to impose a 30 cent tax on every milliliter
of vaping solution.

Vaping retailers and manufacturers say that amounts to an 800 percent tax
increase.

""This will crush the vaping industry in Minnesota,"" said Tim Koester President
of the Independent Vapor Retailers of Minnesota. ""I suspect a majority of
Minnesota vape businesses will not be able to operate much longer if this new
tax is imposed.""

Some retailers may see a tax cut if they've been selling small amounts of vaping
liquid and if the current wholesale prices of tobacco is low.

In fact, the tax change amounts to a more than $9 million cut in state revenue
because the Department of Revenue estimates that 65 percent of e-cigarettes sold
now are the disposable variety - meaning they contain less vaping liquid.

Meanwhile, the House tax bill is a boon for the cigarette industry.

It stops automatic annual increases in the cigarette tax adopted by the
Legislature in 2013, which the Department of Revenue estimates will cost the
state $39 million by the time the provision is fully implemented.

And it effectively reduces the price of cigarette stamps cigarette distributors
buy from the Department of Revenue and are required to affix to their products.
The change will amount to a $4 million hit to the state's general fund for the
biennium.

Thieves who stole £5,000 worth of vaping equipment from a shop in Radcliffe are
being hunted by police.

The Vaping Works on Stand Lane was targeted by crooks on Saturday night some
point between 9.40-11.40pm.

Police say they managed to get in by forcing open a back door before raiding the
place and making off.

A spokesman for the shop, which only opened two months ago, says a wide range of
hardware and liquids were stolen, a full list of which has been posted on its
Facebook page Grumpy Juice.

He said that it's likely the products, which had a retail value of around
£5,000, will have been sold on by now.

The spokesman also said that a group of teenagers and children, some as young as
10, were seen acting suspiciously in the area around the time of the burglary
and that whoever was responsible had dropped ""a trail"" of stolen items along the
river.

He also thanked the online community for its support adding that since they
posted news of the break in, online orders had shot up.

A spokesman for GMP Radcliffe added: ""We are urging anyone with any information
in relation to this crime to get in touch with us on 101 using the reference
number 2615 of January 23.

""I'd also ask that if anyone has bought, or is offered, vaping equipment
matching the description in suspicious circumstances to also report it.""

Vaping rises among Clark County teens

HIGHLIGHT: Use of e-cigarettes has increased among teens in Clark County.



Nearly a quarter of high school seniors in Clark County are using electronic
cigarettes and other vaping devices - more than any other nicotine delivery
method, according to the recently released 2014 Healthy Youth Survey.
The recent survey revealed a significant increase in e-cigarette use among
teens in Clark County and across the state in the past two years. Meanwhile,
Clark County teens' marijuana use remained steady - although their perceived
risk of marijuana use dropped - and youth drinking declined.


The Healthy Youth Survey is administered statewide every two years to students
in sixth, eighth, 10th and 12th grades. Survey answers are voluntary and
anonymous. The October 2014 survey results were released Thursday.
In 2014, 24 percent of high school seniors said they had used e-cigarettes or
vape pens in the previous 30 days. In 2012, just 5 percent of seniors said they
had recently used e-cigarettes (the 2012 survey question did not include vape
pens). Seniors used e-cigarettes more often than cigarettes, cigars,
candy-flavored tobacco, hookah and smokeless tobacco.
The increase in e-cigarette use was similar among 10th-graders (from 4 percent
in 2012 to 21 percent in 2014) and eighth-graders (from 2 percent in 2012 to 10
percent in 2014).
The popularity of vaping devices among youth of all ages is higher in Clark
County than the statewide rate: about 21 percent in Clark County compared to 18
percent statewide. In 2012, 4 percent of Clark County youth said they used
e-cigarettes.
""It's very alarming,"" said Theresa Cross, health educator for Clark County
Public Health's chronic disease prevention program. ""Vaping is becoming more
popular.   Young people are very aware that smoking isn't good for your health,
but vaping doesn't have that same impression.
""They're becoming just as addicted to nicotine (through vaping) as they would
with these other products,"" she added.
Marijuana risks
Marijuana use among Clark County teens remained steady from 2012 to 2014, but
fewer teens reported that they think there are risks to using the drug.
The majority of high school students (70 percent of seniors and 60 percent of
10th-graders) said there was no risk or little risk to trying marijuana once or
twice, according to the 2014 survey. In 2014, about 46 percent of seniors said
there was no risk or little risk to regularly using marijuana (once or twice
per week) - up from 36 percent in 2010, according to the survey.
The 2014 survey also asked students about their habits regarding marijuana use
and driving.
Nearly 18 percent of Clark County youth and 19 percent of youth statewide said
they have ridden in a car driven by someone who had been using marijuana. About
17 percent of Clark County seniors said they have driven a car within three
hours of using marijuana.
""We've got to ring the alarm bell, because teens are telling us in their own
terms that they don't consider marijuana use to be risky and because they're
being duped to start vaping,'?"" said Secretary of Health John Wiesman in a news
release. ""We've got to take the lessons learned about tactics that helped curb
tobacco and alcohol use, and put them to good use educating our kids about
risks of using other substances.""
Alcohol
Youth alcohol consumption continued its downward trend in Clark County,
according to the report.
In 2014, 34 percent of seniors, 20 percent of 10th-graders and 9 percent of
eighth-graders said they had drunk alcohol in the previous 30 days. In 2012, 36
percent of seniors, 23 percent of 10th-graders and 11 percent of eighth-graders
were drinking alcohol in the same time period, according to the survey.
In 2014, about a quarter of high school seniors reported binge drinking, or
drinking three or more days in the previous month, and 9 percent reported
driving after drinking alcohol. Eighteen percent said they rode with a driver
who had been drinking. Those rates were nearly the same in 2012.
""It underscores the need for continued public health and public education of
the danger of these products for young people,"" Cross said. ""We take our
attention away, or our foot off the hose, and the use, the problems don't go
away.""

E-cigarettes: 'Vaping' takes off in America amid raging health debate

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 591 words","


NEW YORK - On the edge of the SoHo neighbourhood in downtown New York, the
Henley Vaporium is an intimate hipster hangout with overstuffed chairs, exposed
brick, friendly counter help - but no booze.

Instead, the proprietors are peddling e-cigarettes, along with bottles of liquid
nicotine ready to be plucked from behind a wooden bar and turned into flavourful
vapour for a lung hit with a kick that is intended to simulate traditional
smoking. A hint of banana nut bread e-juice lingered in the air one recent
afternoon as patrons gathered around a low table to chat and vape, or sidled up
to the inviting bar for help from a knowledgeable ""vapologist.""

Places like the Henley are a rarity, even in New York. But ""vaping,"" itself, has
had astonishing growth - in just eight years or so, the number of enthusiasts
around the world has grown from a few thousand to millions. Believed by some to
be the invention of a Chinese pharmacist, vaping now has its own YouTube gurus,
trade associations, lobbyists, online forums and vapefests for meet-ups centred
on what enthusiasts consider a safer alternative to the ""analog,"" their name for
tobacco cigarettes.

Vaping may be safer - there are differing opinions - but it isn't necessarily
cheap.

Will Hopkins, a 21-year-old dog walker in black leather jacket and skull ring,
visits Henley four or five times a week. He smoked a pack of full-strength
Marlboros a day for eight years, until he took up vaping. The same goes for his
buddy, 20-year-old photographer Will Gallagher, who has been vaping for two
years and is fond of his brass mod, a cylindrical device that's larger than a
cigarette and decorated with a tiger and Chinese lettering.

""I think both of us have poured in probably a little over a thousand"" dollars,
Gallagher said of their equipment. ""I like the exclusivity of vaping. I like to
keep changing up my stuff.""

The Wills are into rebuilding tanks and rewiring coils, scouting new e-liquid
flavours and adjusting their devices, which can cost up to $300 at Henley, to
allow for more vapour, more flavour. But the co-owners of Henley count older
smokers among their clientele as well.

E-cigarettes are usually made of metal parts combined with plastic or glass and
come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

They heat the liquid nicotine solution, creating vapour that quickly dissipates
when exhaled.

The vapour looks like tobacco smoke and can feel like tobacco smoke when taken
into the lungs at varying strengths, from no nicotine up to 24 milligrams or
more.

A 15-millilitre bottle of liquid at Henley can go for $12 and may be roughly the
equivalent of four packs of cigarettes, depending on the strength of both liquid
and leaf cigarette, among other factors like how many puffs a smoker takes in.
Rechargeable devices require batteries - another expense - and a starter kit for
reuse that comes with a device can run around $66.

Critics believe e-cigs may serve as a tobacco gateway for uninitiated young
people. ""It may be smoking e-cigarettes, but it's still smoking,"" said U.S. Sen.
Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who was one of four senators to fire
off a scathing letter to NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association after a
spoof on e-cigs aired during the Golden Globes in January.

Proponents argue that vaping isn't only safe but is helping people quit smoking.
The Henley has a white ""wall of doom,"" where it lists in big black letters the
numerous tars and chemicals found in tobacco cigarettes, but absent in e-cig use
if one is careful about the liquids purchased.

Tulsa World Editorial: Vaping sales ban for kids is good, but not enough

BYLINE: World's Editorials Writers

LENGTH: 282 words","

DATELINE: Tulsa, OK


As of Nov. 1, it will be illegal to sell electronic cigarettes or similar ""
vaping"" products to anyone under age 18 in the state.

Electronic cigarettes are a new fad. They use batteries to heat a liquid that
typically includes nicotine for inhaling. Users get the rush of a cigarette
without the tar or carbon monoxide.

Some have promoted the devices as a means of reducing the danger of smoking or
weaning users from their nicotine habits, although the candy flavorings of some
vaping products made others suspicious that they were aimed at addicting a new,
young audience.

Gov. Mary Fallin signed Senate Bill 1602 last week, prohibiting sales of vaping
products to minors.

Illegal sales under the new law are a misdemeanor, although with repeated
violations a store can have its state tax license suspended, essentially closing
the operation.

The legislation was needed. We praise Fallin for signing it and its legislative
sponsors, most notably Sen. Rob Johnson, R-Edmond, for writing it.

Still, we wish the new law had gone further.

The state missed a chance to give electronic cigarettes the same tax and
regulation status as ordinary cigarettes. As it stands, e-cigarettes are only
subject to the ordinary sales tax, not the tobacco tax. That gives them an
indefensible price advantage for the same addicted market.

Because of that, the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network had urged
Fallin to veto the proposal.

While we wanted more from the bill, we are willing to accept this as a step in
the right direction. The old legislative maxim applies: Don't let the perfect be
the enemy of the good. But we will quickly add that there is still important
work for future legislatures to do.

Admitting that smoking looks kind of cool, and vaping, well, doesn't, kEn ROGAN
still comes to the conclusion that living is even cooler

BYLINE: KEN ROGAN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 697 words","


Smoking is cool. Fact.

Smokers have more sex; drink more beer and own more coffee than nonsmokers. And
here's the kicker - the more you smoke, the truer this is. Are you listening,
teenagers? You're only as cool as the number of cigarettes you smoke.

Smoking is also under attack - but so what? Smoking, like television, is
cultural judo. It uses your own complaints against you. In fact, the nanny state
is Big Tobacco's ace in the hole. Not only do they not care what society says,
they're actually counting on it.

That's what ensures rebellious kids will keep picking up the habit. That, and
the fact they want to be like the cool kids with all the beer, sex and coffee.

And not since the Nazis took the Benelux countries have we seen such a
devastating pincer movement. Nicotine is just the cherry-flavoured nuclear bomb
on top. What possible chance do we stand against this onslaught? e-Cigs look as
they devices from fake 'Vaping' - and yes, I appreciate that's probably what
nuclear bombs do, but until miniature then, vaping is the business of sucking
vaporised nicotine down your gob through a small telescope. And daft though it
surely looks, it threatens to do something that has eluded governments, health
systems, and parents since the dawn of tobacco: make smoking dorky.

And so far it has worked. First off, 'vaping' sounds like 'vapid', which is so
apt it's actually kind of boring. Even more tragically, the word 'vaping', like
democracy, is the worst one except for all the others. eCig is ridiculous.
Cig-alike is pathetic, and technofogger isn't even a joke, even though it
clearly is. eGo is bordering on clever, but then who wants to go for an eGo? Or
an iFag?

And they look as stupid as they sound. The devices range in style from fake
cigarette to miniature clarinet, and you can tell that users - vapers, if you
will (see?!) - are embarrassed, because they palm these mini-soldering irons
from view for fear of looking like a horse trying to tattoo its own gums.

E-smoking sounds like something you'd post on Facebook. 'Ken is smoking'. Ken
likes this. Ken has shared this with his friends. Except you can't share
e-cigarettes. That would be like sharing a thermometer. Who even knows where
that has been, or how long since it was disinfected?

Vaping is way down on the coolometer. Quick aside, I miss the cool-ometer, which
predates the now ubiquitous 'what's hot / what's not' index. What was cool about
cool-ometers is that what was hot was cool and what was cold was uncool, and
things had to be ranked too. They weren't just hot or not.

Anyway, smoking is only cool up to a point - and that point is 27 years of age.
After that it's sad and stupid and yours is the haunted, defeated look of the
addict standing in the rain. And meanwhile there are actually some positives to
vaping. You're not actually chugging down toxic, carcinogenic smoke into your
lungs, which future generations will identify as the clearest evidence of what a
debauched bunch of planet wreckers we were. We even polluted ourselves.

The in style cigarette to clarinet Even so, the jury is still out on the health
effects of e-smoking, but you can bet that glazing your lungs with caramelised
nicotine isn't going to be good for you. Whatever. It still beats the crap out
of actual smoke. That said, real cigarettes do have some advantages. For a
start, they end. And they're ludicrously expensive. But you can sit there
sucking on your vaporiser 24/7 for about a euro a day.

Smoking kills you and not smoking kills you, and you can't catch a cold without
reading eight contradictory headlines about the health benefits or risks of
eating chocolate, drinking red wine, getting too much sunshine and having a
takeaway. Fun is bad for you, but then everything is bad for you. This is
captured by the real story behind those health news headlines, which is
ever-present, if never printed: 'Life to end in death.' That's as biologically
inevitable as it is politically unacceptable. All things considered, vaping is a
step in the right direction. Which, of course, makes it less fun.

Alsa Refinish develops new device for medication delivery

SECTION: TECHNOLOGY; Product Developments

LENGTH: 509 words","



HIGHLIGHT: Alsa Refinish, a California-based company, has process and utility
patent applications in place for a medication delivery method.


If successful, Alsa will hold patents for a device that delivers medications and
herbal preparations directly into the lungs through vaporization, or 'vaping'.
It incorporates technology used in vaporizing pens and e-cigarettes, and in
addition, adds Alsa's proprietary stationary mouth tube design.

Alsa's innovative vaporization technology advances have created devices that can
precisely measure and deliver medication.

Alsa Refinish president Ike Banoun noted vaping the drug would deliver it
directly to the smallest areas of the lungs via harmless vapor.

""Our patents cover vaporizing a wide array of drugs and herbal therapies. The
hypodermic needle is 400 years old. It's time it came into the non-invasive
electronic world. I bet it will be in the museums of the future,"" Banoun added.

Alsa's device could vaporize many pharmaceutical drugs, NSAIDs, herbal
supplements and vitamins. Good pharmaceutical candidates for vaporization
include, but are not restricted to, nitroglycerin, sildenafil (Viagra),
antibiotics and active ingredients of cough syrups.

Patients that have asthma or cystic fibrosis could replace their inhalers with
vaping devices to disinfect and treat the mucus with mucolytics in their lungs.
Additionally, diabetic patients could also be delivered insulin via
non-parenteral routes instead of taking painful injections.

The drug classes listed on Alsa's patent applications include antipyretic
medications for fever reduction; NSAIDs to relieve pain, swelling and
inflammation; and both opioid and non-opioid analgesics for pain relief.

Heat-stable medications from any of these classes could potentially be
administered through vaporization. Readily available treatments like Vicks
Vaporub (active ingredients) could be delivered directly into the lungs instead
of being smeared on the chest. Also, patients could use vaping devices to inhale
therapeutic herbs in liquid form.

In addition to delivering medication through the mouth, vaporization can be used
to administer medication nasally. This method of delivering medication doesn't
pass through the stomach and liver, so it prevents loss of potency.

In this way, vaping devices have the potential to treat diseases more easily and
quickly, and to deliver analgesics for more effective pain management.
Medications can also be flavored for making them palatable and for ease in
administering to children.

Alsa envisions its vaping device as an effective and low-cost vaccine delivery
solution for not-for-profit groups and healthcare providers. They could
vaccinate the entire village with a single vaporization device, and inexpensive
disposable tips to eliminate cross-contamination.

In fact, Alsa hopes to partner with the Gates Foundation to increase worldwide
vaccine acceptance, availability and delivery.

Vaporization pens and e-cigarettes have widespread consumer appeal. These
patents could present profitable financial opportunities for both investors and
strategic partners. Interested parties can contact Alsa Refinish to discuss
possible joint ventures and investments.

Teens who vape e-cigarettes turning to tobacco, USC researchers find

BYLINE: Susan Abram

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 715 words","


Researchers with USC and other universities found that teens who try
e-cigarettes are more likely to turn to tobacco products than those who have
never tried vaping.

The study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
shows that 31 percent of the 222 youths who had tried vaping turned to
cigarettes, cigars and hookahs six months after they first were surveyed. Among
those who never tried vaping, 8 percent had tried tobacco products in the same
time period.

Researchers surveyed 2,530 teens, all 14-year-olds from nearly a dozen Los
Angeles area high schools, including in the San Gabriel and San Fernando
valleys, over a yearlong period ending last fall.

It s unclear why some teens who vape turn to tobacco, said Adam Leventhal , an
associate professor and director of the USC Health, Emotion and Addiction
Laboratory at the Keck School of Medicine who led the study.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine with flavorings
and that could be the answer, he said.

One of our hypotheses is nicotine is highly addictive,  Leventhal said.  Among
teens, a significant portion find the experience pleasurable, and so they might
be more open to trying tobacco.

He also said the results show that when looking at how to design policies to
protect public health, a distinction should be made between adults who are
smokers who use e-cigarettes for tobacco reduction and teens who vape for
recreation.

State bills that propose regulating e-cigarettes as a tobacco product are
expected to be discussed Wednesday by lawmakers during a special session in
Sacramento.

E-cigarettes may be drawing a new generation of teens into recreational nicotine
use because they are high-tech, can be purchased somewhat easily, come in
enticing flavors and have a perception that they re not harmful,  he said.  Some
e-cigarette devices appear to be very efficient at delivering nicotine to the
lungs and brain.

Leventhal said researchers accounted for some risk factors such as friends who
smoke, but not all, a fact that the American Vaping Association grasped as to
why the results should be interpreted with caution.

Even though teen experimentation with vapor products is tied to the most
dramatic decline in youth smoking in U.S. history, there appears no shortage of
politically driven commentators who are eager to paint vaping as a gateway to
smoking,  said Gregory Conley, president of the association.  Unfortunately,
ardent opponents of vaping have a history of making wild and unsubstantiated
claims, and this study will be twisted and used to push for unjustified excise
taxes and small-business-killing regulations.

Conley said since e-cigarettes were introduced 10 years ago, the products have
helped millions of adults quit smoking.

But keeping teens away is proving difficult.

Earlier this year, the California Department of Public Health declared liquid
nicotine projects a public health threat due to the escalated use of
e-cigarettes among teens and young adults. Researchers found that more than
twice as many 8th- and 10th-graders reported vaping than smoking traditional
cigarettes in 2014. Among seniors in high school, more than 17 percent said they
used e-cigarettes compared with 14 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes.

The study is believed to be a first of its kind and was funded by the federal
Food and Drug Administration through the National Institutes of Health. In July,
the FDA issued a brief on e-cigarettes but had no answers on the health risks of
the devices. Because the products have not been fully studied, consumers don t
know the potential risks, how much nicotine or other chemicals are being inhaled
and whether there are any benefits, according to the agency s brief.

Leventhal said he believes the study is important because it coincides with the
national phenomenon of teens and vaping.

I think restrictions against use (among teens) is an important positive step,
Leventhal said.  Another potential question is the oversight of types of flavors
and marketing strategies that are attractive to youth. All health professionals
would agree that smoking cigarettes, or hookah or cigars is one of the most
dangerous things you could do to your health. Anything associated with that we
would want to try to prevent.

e-cigarettes are more likely to turn to tobacco products than those who have
never tried vaping.

The study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
shows that 31 percent of the 222 youths who had tried vaping turned to
cigarettes, cigars and hookahs six months after they first were surveyed. Among
those who never tried vaping, 8 percent had tried tobacco products in the same
time period.

Researchers surveyed 2,530 teens, all 14-year-olds from nearly a dozen Los
Angeles area high schools, including in the San Gabriel and San Fernando
valleys, over a yearlong period ending last fall.

It s unclear why some teens who vape turn to tobacco, said Adam Leventhal , an
associate professor and director of the USC Health, Emotion and Addiction
Laboratory at the Keck School of Medicine who led the study.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine with flavorings
and that could be the answer, he said.

One of our hypotheses is nicotine is highly addictive,  Leventhal said.  Among
teens, a significant portion find the experience pleasurable, and so they might
be more open to trying tobacco.

He also said the results show that when looking at how to design policies to
protect public health, a distinction should be made between adults who are
smokers who use e-cigarettes for tobacco reduction and teens who vape for
recreation.

State bills that propose regulating e-cigarettes as a tobacco product are
expected to be discussed Wednesday by lawmakers during a special session in
Sacramento.

E-cigarettes may be drawing a new generation of teens into recreational nicotine
use because they are high-tech, can be purchased somewhat easily, come in
enticing flavors and have a perception that they re not harmful,  he said.  Some
e-cigarette devices appear to be very efficient at delivering nicotine to the
lungs and brain.

Leventhal said researchers accounted for some risk factors such as friends who
smoke, but not all, a fact that the American Vaping Association grasped as to
why the results should be interpreted with caution.

Even though teen experimentation with vapor products is tied to the most
dramatic decline in youth smoking in U.S. history, there appears no shortage of
politically driven commentators who are eager to paint vaping as a gateway to
smoking,  said Gregory Conley, president of the association.  Unfortunately,
ardent opponents of vaping have a history of making wild and unsubstantiated
claims, and this study will be twisted and used to push for unjustified excise
taxes and small-business-killing regulations.

Conley said since e-cigarettes were introduced 10 years ago, the products have
helped millions of adults quit smoking.

But keeping teens away is proving difficult.

Earlier this year, the California Department of Public Health declared liquid
nicotine projects a public health threat due to the escalated use of
e-cigarettes among teens and young adults. Researchers found that more than
twice as many 8th- and 10th-graders reported vaping than smoking traditional
cigarettes in 2014. Among seniors in high school, more than 17 percent said they
used e-cigarettes compared with 14 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes.

The study is believed to be a first of its kind and was funded by the federal
Food and Drug Administration through the National Institutes of Health. In July,
the FDA issued a brief on e-cigarettes but had no answers on the health risks of
the devices. Because the products have not been fully studied, consumers don t
know the potential risks, how much nicotine or other chemicals are being inhaled
and whether there are any benefits, according to the agency s brief.

Leventhal said he believes the study is important because it coincides with the
national phenomenon of teens and vaping.

I think restrictions against use (among teens) is an important positive step,
Leventhal said.  Another potential question is the oversight of types of flavors
and marketing strategies that are attractive to youth. All health professionals
would agree that smoking cigarettes, or hookah or cigars is one of the most
dangerous things you could do to your health. Anything associated with that we
would want to try to prevent.

Ramsey County bans use of electronic cigarettes in public spaces

BYLINE: By Sarah Horner shorner@pioneerpress.com

SECTION: RAMSEY COUNTY

LENGTH: 516 words","


Ramsey County will become the 10th county in the state and the second in the
metro area to ban the use of electronic cigarettes in nearly all places where
smoking is prohibited.

The Ramsey County Board voted 6-1 Tuesday to approve a new Clean Indoor Air
Ordinance that restricts the use of electronic cigarettes -- or ""vaping"" --
inside bars, restaurants, movie theaters, churches and a host of other places
across the county that now have no uniform restrictions.

Commissioner Janice Rettman cast the lone vote against the measure.

""I have gotten phone calls (from people) on both sides,"" Commissioner Rafael
Ortega said before the vote. ""The bottom line is ... if there is any uncertainty
about the impact that (vaping) has on health ... it is better to move in the
direction we are moving in, making sure that we keep enhancing the health of our
community.""

Commissioner Blake Huffman commented on the diverse group of people that turned
out for a hearing on the proposal earlier in the month, including a teenager,
the mayor of Maplewood and a doctor. All spoke in favor of the ordinance.

""(They) all (said) the same thing, that we should treat e-cigarettes like we
treat regular cigarettes,"" he said.

The ordinance includes language that mandates vaping take place at least 25 feet
from all doors of public places and places of business.

Owners of bars and restaurants still could allow e-cigarette use on patios. It
also would be permitted inside shops that sell e-cigarettes for the purpose of
sampling.

It was the verbiage on vaping near entrances that stopped Rettman from
supporting the ordinance. She said the language was added after a county board
workshop on the ordinance.

Ramsey County joins Hennepin, St. Louis, Olmstead, Beltrami, Marshall, McLeod,
Dodge, Houston and Big Stone counties and 20 Minnesota cities in its decision to
regulate vaping.

The state expanded its own Clean Indoor Act last year to restrict e-cigarette
use in licensed day cares, health care facilities, public schools and government
buildings.

Although supportive of the state's step, staff members at the Association for
Nonsmokers-Minnesota said it didn't go far enough.

Representatives from the organization and other supporters of the Ramsey County
ordinance maintain that vaping infringes on residents' right to clean air and
exposes them to potential health risks associated with chemicals found in
e-cigarettes.

They also say certain e-cigarette flavors target children.

Opponents, including the Independent Vapor Retailers of Minnesota, say
e-cigarettes are different from tobacco products and should not be treated the
same. They say the devices actually improve public health by helping wean
smokers off cigarettes.

E-cigarettes emerged nationally about 2009 and have grown in popularity.

Not yet fully researched, the potential risks or benefits of e-cigarettes are
not known, according to information posted on the Food and Drug Administration's
website.

Ramsey County's new ordinance is expected to go into effect in mid-November.

Teens who vape e-cigarettes turning to tobacco, USC researchers find

LENGTH: 717 words","


Researchers with USC and other universities found that teens who try
e-cigarettes are more likely to turn to tobacco products than those who have
never tried vaping.

The study, published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
shows that 31 percent of the 222 youths who had tried vaping turned to
cigarettes, cigars and hookahs six months after they first were surveyed. Among
those who never tried vaping, 8 percent had tried tobacco products in the same
time period.

Researchers surveyed 2,530 teens, all 14-year-olds from nearly a dozen Los
Angeles area high schools, including in the San Gabriel and San Fernando
valleys, over a yearlong period ending last fall.

It s unclear why some teens who vape turn to tobacco, said Adam Leventhal , an
associate professor and director of the USC Health, Emotion and Addiction
Laboratory (USC-HEAL) at the Keck School of Medicine who led the study.

E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine with flavorings
and that could be the answer, he said.

One of our hypotheses is nicotine is highly addictive,  Leventhal said.  Among
teens, a significant portion find the experience pleasurable, and so they might
be more open to trying tobacco.

He also said the results show that when looking at how to design policies to
protect public health, a distinction should be made between adults who are
smokers who use e-cigarettes for tobacco reduction and teens who vape for
recreation.

State bills that propose regulating e-cigarettes as a tobacco product are
expected to be discussed Wednesday by lawmakers during a special session in
Sacramento.

E-cigarettes may be drawing a new generation of teens into recreational nicotine
use because they are high-tech, can be purchased somewhat easily, come in
enticing flavors and have a perception that they re not harmful,  he said.  Some
e-cigarette devices appear to be very efficient at delivering nicotine to the
lungs and brain.

Leventhal said researchers accounted for some risk factors such as friends who
smoke, but not all, a fact that the American Vaping Association grasped as to
why the results should be interpreted with caution.

Even though teen experimentation with vapor products is tied to the most
dramatic decline in youth smoking in U.S. history, there appears no shortage of
politically driven commentators who are eager to paint vaping as a gateway to
smoking,  said Gregory Conley, president of the association.  Unfortunately,
ardent opponents of vaping have a history of making wild and unsubstantiated
claims, and this study will be twisted and used to push for unjustified excise
taxes and small-business-killing regulations.

Conley said since e-cigarettes were introduced 10 years ago, the products have
helped millions of adults quit smoking.

But keeping teens away is proving difficult.

Earlier this year, the California Department of Public Health declared liquid
nicotine projects a public health threat due to the escalated use of
e-cigarettes among teens and young adults. Researchers found that more than
twice as many 8th- and 10th-graders reported vaping than smoking traditional
cigarettes in 2014. Among seniors in high school, more than 17 percent said they
used e-cigarettes compared with 14 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes.

The study is believed to be a first of its kind and was funded by the federal
Food and Drug Administration through the National Institutes of Health. In July,
the FDA issued a brief on e-cigarettes but had no answers on the health risks of
the devices. Because the products have not been fully studied, consumers don t
know the potential risks, how much nicotine or other chemicals are being inhaled
and whether there are any benefits, according to the agency s brief.

Leventhal said he believes the study is important because it coincides with the
national phenomenon of teens and vaping.

I think restrictions against use (among teens) is an important positive step,
Leventhal said.  Another potential question is the oversight of types of flavors
and marketing strategies that are attractive to youth. All health professionals
would agree that smoking cigarettes, or hookah or cigars is one of the most
dangerous things you could do to your health. Anything associated with that we
would want to try to prevent.

Boulder adopts broad ban on smoking outdoors

BYLINE: Erica Meltzer

SECTION: ASECTION; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 260 words","


BOULDER Smokers will no longer be able to light up in the downtown business
district, in city parks, open space or within 25 feet of bus stops, multi use
paths and entrances to buildings.

The Boulder City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to adopt the outdoor
smoking ban, the latest in a series of bans that started with a prohibition on
smoking on the Pearl Street Mall in 2012.

Last year, the city banned smoking in the Civic Area and near Boulder High
School through city manager's rules.

The broad outdoor smoking ban applies to electronic cigarettes as well as
conventional cigarettes, and that issue was the sole source of disagreement
among the people who spoke at a public hearing on the ordinance.

Kevan Masters told the City Council he smoked for 22 years and finally was able
to quit by switching to vaping.

Electronic cigarettes usually contain a battery operated heating element that
vaporizes a solution containing nicotine. That vapor is inhaled by the user.
Unless the solution is flavored which it often is there is no odor.

Advocates of vaping say it is much safer than smoking cigarettes and provides an
alternative for people who have been unable to quit in other ways.

They told the City Council banning vaping in public sends a message to smokers
that they should just keep smoking cigarettes because there is no difference.
They contend that vaping has no equivalent to second hand smoke that would harm
passers by.

But Boulder County Public Health Director Jeff Zayach said studies have shown
some of the byproducts of vaping may be harmful.

FirstUnion Group: ISMK Launches Three E-Cigarette Solutions with New Features

LENGTH: 422  words","


May 20 -- ISMK, the subsidiary of the World's Largest OEM/ODM supplier for
e-cigarettes, FirstUnion, has launched three new vaping products that offer
innovative features for stylish use and convenience. EVOD, eGo-T CE9, and iGo5
featuring voltage adjustment are the new hot items to capture the vaping world.



Available in a wide variety of stylish colors, the new EVOD comes with a
visibility window to monitor the remaining vaping liquid and it also features a
new invisible wick system. The robust metallic body with a smooth rubberized
finish means it will look good and last with long use. It comes with a
replaceable atomizer head which is easy to switch out. The EVOD also has a
self-lock feature. It's a metallic switch button that self-locks to avoid
accidental use. All in all, it is simple, smooth, and fashionable.

The eGo-T CE9 is an upgraded version from the popular CE series featuring a
cleaner look with a better draw. The atomizer head is invisible, giving a more
streamlined look, and it is replaceable, making it more economical. It also has
the switch button for better control of the e-cigarette. Its transparent tank
with an increased e-liquid capacity means prolonged vaping and no frequent
refillings. The tank is precisely calibrated so that the user knows how much
vaping liquid is left within and can refill beforehand avoiding a run-out.

And what's more, eGo-T CE9 is widely compatible with most iGo and eGo batteries
available in the market, without any rings or adaptive parts required.

The iGo5 is the latest e-cigarette featuring voltage adjustment. This allows you
to freely control the vapor intensity. It has an LED switch button and a vapor
intensity controller dial that rotates 360 degrees. The voltage is adjustable
from the 3 V to 5 V range. The CE4 version has clear scale markings with a
detachable mouthpiece while the CE6 version has a higher e-liquid capacity with
detachable clearomizer head. The iGo5 has the electronics covered, featuring
short circuit protection, atomizer protection, low voltage protection, and
overheating protection.

Since FirstUnion is OEM/ODM oriented, these ISMK products are available to 3rd
party companies including distributors and retailers to develop into their own
products and unique marketing conditions. All products will be available for
licensing and capturing market shares. Therefore, FirstUnion is looking for
partners for a strong and long-lasting ISMK business relationship. FirstUnion is
ready to welcome qualified and established partners worldwide.

from their own home would be barred from vaping (E Cigarettes) in certain rooms
and between working hours and if caught could be taken to court and fined and
this new law, if implemented, would be policed by council officers.

Don't they (WAG) know that court houses are closing up and down the country and
local authorities are already starved of money and cannot run services now
without having officials walking our streets checking through windows if there

Hutchinson City Council bans e-cigs, vaping in most public places

BYLINE: Adam Stewart, The Hutchinson News, Kan.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 751 words","


Nov. 04--The Hutchinson City Council unanimously passed an ordinance Tuesday
banning the use of electronic cigarettes in most public areas and workplaces.

City Attorney Paul W. Brown said the ordinance closely mirrored the Kansas
Indoor Clean Air Act that went into effect in 2010.

The new ordinance includes exemptions for smoke shops, including e-cigarette
shops, private clubs, up to 20 percent of hotel rooms, casinos and designated
smoking areas of long-term care facilities.

The ordinance requires businesses to post no smoking or vaping signs.

Sondra Borth, of Communities That Care of Reno County, said that organization
could provide the signs free of charge. Businesses can reach Communities That
Care at (620) 615-4018 or borths@usd308.com

High school student members of Communities That Care lobbied the City Council,
requesting the ordinance at the beginning of September, arguing that secondhand
e-cigarette aerosol poses a health risk to non-users. At a later public hearing,
Reno County Health Department gave its support to the ordinance. Vapor shops and
their customers and employees argued that e-cigarettes' value in helping smokers
quit outweighed any public health risk.

No supporters or opponents of the ordinance spoke Tuesday.

At a previous council meeting, council members Nancy Soldner and Jon Daveline
said they thought it was important to have consistency in rules for smoking and
vaping. Council member David Inskeep said he wanted to be cautious until more
research is done on the health effects of secondhand aerosol.

Council member Steve Dechant asked Brown about some of the definitions in the
ordinance. Brown said they matched the definitions in the Kansas Indoor Clean
Air Act except for a few revisions to include e-cigarettes.

The ban goes into effect after the city publishes the full ordinance Friday in
the official paper of record, The Hutchinson News.

Change in agreement with Convention/Visitors Bureau

A change earlier this year in the city's agreement with the Atrium Hotel for
conference center improvements is now paying off for the Greater Hutchinson
Convention/Visitors Bureau.

Now that the city is retaining 1 percent transient guest tax for maintenance of
tourism-related facilities, the city is ending a requirement for the tourism
bureau to pay back a portion of its 4 percent guest tax to the city for those
facilities.

The previous agreement started with a $25,000 payment to the city. Because of
increases in collections over the years, that had risen to around $60,000 a
year, City Manager John Deardoff said. The 1 percent the city is now retaining
results in around $90,000 a year.

In place of the payment to the city, the tourism bureau will set aside one-tenth
of its guest tax revenue, up to $50,000, for recruitment of large events to the
city. Such events should result in 500 additional hotel stays in Hutchinson.
That could be 250 rooms for two nights or 100 rooms for five nights, Deardoff
said.

""There is enormous potential with our new facility,"" Mayor Jade Piros de
Carvalho said, referring to the renovation and expansion of the Hutchinson
Sports Arena.

The Convention/Visitors Bureau will make one final $27,178 payment to the city.
The council unanimously approved the new agreement.

In other business, the council:

-- Approved selling about $5 million in general obligation bonds for
reconstruction of a fire station, repairs at City Hall, projects at Carey Park
Golf Course and Fun Valley and starting work on the Hutchinson Sports Arena
renovation and expansion. The city had eight bidders, with Country Club Bank
winning the bonds with an interest rate of 1.96 percent. Director of Finance
Frank Edwards said the winning bid would save $37,000 in the first year alone
compared to the average rate of the bids.

-- Granted a conditional use permit for an electrician apprentice school to open
in a building at 200 W. Second Ave. that has been vacant for several years.

-- Greeted 12 AmeriCorps volunteers working with Interfaith Housing Services
Inc. for seven weeks. Jeff Thompson said another group may be here for 13 weeks
in spring 2016.

-- Met in closed session for an hour to discuss personnel issues, employee
negotiations and trade secrets of a third party. No action was taken after the
closed session.

-- Made proclamations for National Hospice Month and Veterans Appreciation
Month.

Mentally stronger Teens Prefer Vaping Over Smoking: Study

LENGTH: 213 words","

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 -- According to a study conducted by a team of researchers
from the University of Southern California, adolescents with judicious emotional
health or who are mentally stronger opt for vaping over smoking. Researchers
found that mental health and behavioural problems like alcohol and drug abuse
force teens to smoke.

An electronic cigarette is a battery-powered vaporizer which simulates the
feeling of smoking, but without burning tobacco. The three main types of
e-cigarettes are cigalikes, eGos, and MODs. Their use is commonly called ""vaping
"". The user activates the e-cigarette by taking a puff or pressing a button.

For the study, the researchers enrolled teens as study subjects. The findings of
the study revealed that teens that chose vaping over smoking had emotional and
behavioral problems that fell midway between smokers and teens who neither vaped
nor smoked.

The study also found that teens that use prescription drugs to get high were
more likely smoke than to vape e-cigarettes.

The study is published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research.

Lungs designed only for fresh air

BYLINE: Datuk Wee Beng Gee

SECTION: Viewpoint; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 194 words","


EXPERTS, doctors and the government have given their views on the dangers of
vaping.

On one hand, the views are about the health aspect, but, on the other, there are
those who disagree for the reason that it will kill the industry, which some
claim is supported by some businessmen.

I am not a smoker. What I understand is that vaping contains nicotine and that
little data exists on the safety of e-cigarettes.

In the United States, there is no federal law banning e-cigarettes, but states
and cities promulgate laws for minors.

As in the United Kingdom, there is no likelihood that e-cigarettes will be
banned.

Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causes diseases and endangers the
health of smokers.

In the US, nearly 400,000 deaths are recorded annually as a result of smoking.

So where do we go from here?

If we look at the dangers of vaping and smoking, both are harmful.

So if vaping is to be banned, then smoking should also be banned as well.

As a group of doctors said at a press conference to commemorate World Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Day, fresh air is the only thing that lungs are
designed for.

Southern Sugar Vapes offers smoking alternative

BYLINE: Sharon Myers, The Dispatch, Lexington, N.C.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 490 words","


June 30--Leanna Warner, who owns the store with her mother-in-law, Janice Gray,
and her sister-in-law, Lisa Shuler, said that as former smokers, they want to
provide education and opportunity for vaping, also known as electronic
cigarettes.

""We are big advocates of quitting smoking,"" Warner said. ""Vaping is a better
alternative, and we wanted to be able to provide Lexington with that option.
Tobacco cigarettes have over 500 chemicals including tar and nicotine. There are
so many negative things, but when you're a smoker you don't think about it. We
know it's bad for us, but we don't know the depth of how bad.""

Warner said the concept for the store came after Shuler decided to quit smoking
and was introduced to vaping. She then brought it to the attention of the other
two women, who both used vaping to quit smoking traditional cigarettes. Warner
said they were so impressed with the results they thought it necessary to help
others quit the habit.

""We saw a need in town for a store with good quality and good service,"" Warner
said. ""There is nothing tobacco related in our store. We saw that vaping worked
for us, and we wanted to help out the citizens of Lexington.""

Southern Sugar Vapes carries only USDA approved products, and all lines are made
in the United States. Warner said although there are not any regulations on
e-juice, they order high-quality products that contain only four ingredients and
should not be impacted by any new guidelines.

The store offers a variety of equipment, from starter kits to gear for the more
experienced smoker. The business carries four basic e-juice lines, including the
North Carolina-based company Iron Crow, and offers 52 flavors with varying
levels of nicotine. Warner stressed they do not sell any of their products to
anyone under the age of 18.

Southern Sugar Vapes opened May 16, and Warner said it has received a warm
response from the community. She said she wants to be an advocate for smokers
and to teach them all the facts and benefits of quitting smoking cigarettes.

""I enjoy those new customers who know nothing about vaping,"" Warner said. ""I
show my passion and want to let them know it is a better alternative to tobacco.
Ideally, no one should smoke at all, but this is a tool if someone wants to
quit. I want to spread the word and to educate the citizens of Lexington. We did
not open this store to make a lot of money, we did it to help our community.""

Southern Sugar Vapes is at 110-A Cotton Grove Road. Hours of operation are 10
a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday and
Saturday. For more information, check out the Facebook page at

Professors support varsity vaping ban

BYLINE: National Council of Professors

SECTION: Letters; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 543 words","


THE announcement by the higher education minister in November on banning vaping
and e-cigarettes in 20 public universities has resulted in affirmative actions
by state governments.

Johor, Terengganu and Kelantan, have banned vape sales and have stopped issuing
business licenses for e-cigarettes, including vape.

The National Fatwa Council has declared that e-cigarettes and vape are haram for
Muslims, and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Kedah, Negri Sembilan,
Malacca, Perak and Penang have declared the use of vape as haram.

Studies have been done on the detrimental effects of vaping on health.

In a study conducted by Jensen et al (2015), they reported the formation of
formaldehyde-containing hemiacetals during vaping when e-cigarettes were heated
at high voltage.

Formaldehyde is carcinogen and is used as industrial biocides. The study claimed
that long-term vaping could expose a person to lifetime cancer risk of five to
15 times higher than smoking.

Other studies have reported concerns about the safety of vaping. These include a
study by Jerry et al (2015) from Cleveland Clinic, which expressed concerns
related to propylene glycol, an additive content of e-cigarettes that has raised
health issues.

Several studies were conducted by exposing volunteers to propylene glycol fog
used in theatre fog machines.

These studies found statistically significant evidence of throat and vocal cord
inflammation with prolonged peak exposure to glycols. They suggested that humans
should not be exposed to glycol concentrations of more than 40 mg/m3.

A similar study was done with a lower concentration and resulted with
deleterious respiratory effects among volunteers.

Another study conducted by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health
recently tested 51 e-cigarette flavours containing diacetyl, a flavouring
chemical linked to cases of severe respiratory disease, mainly popcorn lung.

Popcorn lung is a term for respiratory disease bronchiolitis obliterans that
first appeared in workers who inhaled artificial butter flavour containing
diacetyl chemical while working in microwave popcorn-processing facilities. The
chemicals destroy the lungs' tiniest airways, causing scar tissue build-up that
blocks airflow.

Last month, researchers from the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare Systems
identified two e-cigarettes products that cause DNA strand breaks and cell death
that could lead to cancer, even when nicotine-free.

They created an extract from e-cigarette vapour and exposed the human cells to
it in petri dishes. The exposed cells showed breaks in DNA strand and were more
likely to go into necrosis, which could cause cell death.

Damaged cells will eventually disrupt the cellular repair process and set the
stage for cancer.

One of the lead researchers of this study, Dr Jessica Wang-Rodrique, claimed
that nicotine alone is not sufficient to cause these changes, but the presence
of other components in e-cigarettes contribute to the causes of these damages.

One of them is formaldehyde and the other one is the chemical flavouring
diacetyl.

Based on the above studies, we support the ban of vaping in public universities
and other academic institutions.

Irish Rail outlaws vaping in its trains and stations

BYLINE: Christian MCCashin

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 658 words","


THE 'smoking' of electronic cigarettes has been banned on all Irish trains and
Dublin's Dart service, it has emerged.

The habit, known as 'vaping', involves inhaling a nicotineinfused vapour - and
Irish Rail has banned it from any places that cigarettes are prohibited
following passenger complaints. The company is now putting up posters in
stations and on trains, alerting people to the new rule.

The ban on the e-cigarettes was brought in last month. With an estimated 45,000
users of ecigarettes nationwide, thousands of rail users are expected to be
affected by the ban.

Along with the concerns from passengers, Irish Rail chiefs also expressed fears
that smokers would think it was okay to light up if they saw a person vaping.

An Irish Rail spokesman said: 'You'll be able to ""vape"" in smoking areas - in
places that aren't covered over, like outdoor platforms where you can smoke
traditional cigarettes.

'We brought this policy in recently as a result of feedback from customers who
were uneasy about people ""vaping"" in a carriage or a covered area in a station,'
the Irish Rail spokesman added.

'Customers' concerns were that even though it's a vapour, it's still coming into
their atmosphere, and it's not a situation where you can step away when you're
on a train.

'The other side of it is, some of these e-cigarettes are very, very like
traditional cigarettes so it may lead to some ambiguity about what a person is
actually smoking.' The spokesman added that 'there are still unanswered
questions about what comes out of these devices so we just made the decision
that we don't permit it on any of our services or at any stations under cover'.
'We have a very high rate of compliance with the smoking ban and we very rarely
have people smoking on trains or stations and that's the way we'd like to keep
it,' the Irish Rail official said.

'Nearly all the railway companies across Europe and the UK have a similar policy
with replacement cigarettes.' However, a spokesman for the Electronic Cigarette
Industry Trade Association, which promotes the use of e-cigarettes as an
alternative to smoking, hit out at the move. They said: 'That it would make
people think they could smoke is a very poor argument.

'It's almost instantly obvious the difference between vapour and smoke because
you don't get the smell of smoke, which not only permeates rapidly, but it
smells horrific - whereas vapour disperses very quickly. We don't think it's a
defensible argument.' E-cigarettes were recently banned for under-18s by Health
Minister James Reilly, who plans to bring in further regulations.

Expressing concern about the ecigarettes, which have become a popular substitute
for people trying to quit smoking, Dr Reilly said: 'They might be safer than
regular tobacco insofar as they don't have all the other toxins in them but they
still, I believe, are not safe I believe.' Celebrities such as Rolling Stone
guitarist Ronnie Wood are often photographed with e-cigarettes.

There are now believed to be 45,000 e-cigarette users in Ireland, according to
retailers in the booming market. And some say business has doubled in the past
year alone, although official figures are not available.

Some anti-smoking campaigners have attacked them as trying to 'normalise' the
habit again.

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Minister Reilly intends to regulate the
e-cigarette market.

This will include banning their sale to under-18s... Minister Reilly is
currently reviewing the evidence on the potential harm and the potential
benefits of e-cigarettes before deciding the best approach to their wider
regulation.' A HSE spokesman said: 'Based on the 24,000 people who used our
online, interactive QUIT plan, an estimated 480,000 attempts to quit have been
made in Ireland since June 2011.' The number of smokers has fallen by 28 per
cent in the past seven years, leaving around 800,000 in the country.

Understanding of local, state laws regarding e-cigarettes often hazy

BYLINE: Marissa Harshman Columbian staff writer; Clark County Public Health

SECTION: HEALTH LOCAL; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 636 words","



HIGHLIGHT: Clark County Public Health made new ""No Smoking"" signs to include
language prohibiting the use of electronic cigarettes. The health department is
distributing the signs to local businesses that prohibit e-cigarette use.


Smoking has long been banned inside public places. But with the emergence and
surging popularity of electronic cigarettes, local public health officials are
fielding a common question among business owners: What about vaping?
Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-operated devices that
vaporize liquid nicotine, which is then inhaled by the user. The act of using
the devices has been coined ""vaping.""


Theresa Cross, a health educator for Clark County Public Health's chronic
disease prevention program, receives a few calls each month from employers,
employees and the public asking about the legality of using e-cigarettes inside
private businesses.
""The state smoking ban doesn't cover these devices,"" Cross said of
e-cigarettes.
In December 2005, the Smoking in Public Places law (formerly the Washington
Clean Indoor Air Act) went into effect, making it illegal to smoke in all
indoor public places and workplaces in Washington.
That was before electronic cigarettes appeared on the market. The current state
law does not prohibit e-cigarettes or vaping.
King and Spokane counties have modified their local ordinances to prohibit the
use of e-cigarettes anywhere cigarette smoking is prohibited. Clark County has
prohibited the sale of e-cigarettes to minors but has not placed restrictions
on their use by adults.
But that doesn't mean business owners can't prohibit vaping.
Some people have argued business owners can't prohibit the devices because
they're not included in the state law. That, Cross said, isn't the case.
""They don't have to allow them if they don't want to,"" she said.
And public health officials encourage businesses to prohibit vaping anywhere
smoking is prohibited for several reasons.
For starters, health officials worry the increased use of e-cigarettes will
once again normalize smoking, especially among kids and teens, and threaten the
declining smoking rates, Cross said. In addition, electronic cigarette use
inside businesses can cause confusion if customers think a person is smoking a
tobacco cigarette, she said.
Finally, the long-term health affects of the exhaled steam - both on those
vaping and others in the area - is still unknown, Cross said.
""It is steam, but it contains other components,"" Cross said. ""We don't always
know how much is in it because they're not regulated.""
Education effort
Clark County Public Health is now working to educate business owners about
their rights regarding e-cigarettes.
The health department has long offered businesses ""No smoking"" signs for their
windows. A couple of months ago, they updated the signs.
The green signs now say, ""No smoking, including electronic cigarettes."" Health
officials are offering the signs to any local business that wants them. They're
also distributing fact sheets, outlining business owners' rights regarding
e-cigarettes.
Russell Brent, owner of Mill Creek Pub in Battle Ground, has always prohibited
the use of electronic cigarettes in his restaurant but never publicized the
policy. He recently made the rules clear, placing one of the health
department's new signs in the restaurant window.
For Brent, the decision to prohibit e-cigarettes was an easy one.
The nicotine in e-cigarettes come in a variety of flavors, such as chocolate,
vanilla, strawberry, cherry and mint. The steam users exhale still holds that
scent and can interfere with other diners in the restaurant.
""If someone is smoking an e-cigarette, it's going to affect your dining
experience,"" Brent said.
Brent hasn't received any push-back over the policy. Most customers are
respectful and take their electronic cigarettes out to the patio, just as they
would with a cigarette, he said.
""In the restaurant business, it's a no-brainer,"" he said of the policy.

Vaping takes off among young

BYLINE: Siobhán Maguire

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 255 words","


A QUARTER of 16 to 17-year-olds have tried vaping before using tobacco products,
a study by the TobaccoFree Research Institute has found.

The Dublin Institute of Technology-based organisation examined
electronic-cigarette usage among young people in Ireland. The study, conducted
in 2014, found a total of 23.8% of minors had vaped at least once.

Tobacco and e-cigarettes were common to the almost 70% of the group that
admitted being regular smokers, while almost one third of smokers had tried
vaping. One-tenth of smokers use the electronic devices regularly.

""These findings provide a grounding from which inquiry on e-cigarette use among
young people can continue to develop,"" said the report. ""The data show that
e-cigarettes are widely tried by young people in Ireland, particularly by those
who smoke or have tried smoking. Irish data aligns with international data,
demonstrating a relationship between tobacco use and e-cigarette use.""

The study used a representative sample of 821 young people recruited from
secondary schools.

They were asked about vaping and tobacco use, and socio-demographic items.
Gender and class were good indicators of use. Males are more likely to use
e-cigarettes at least once a month.

The Irish Vape Vendors Association, an industry group for retailers of
e-cigarettes, said it supports a ban on sales of e-cigarettes to young people.
They say vaping devices are not suitable for teenagers, only adult smokers. The
association added that the small sample size left the latest study ""prone to
error"".

Bans on e-cigs are premature

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. 15A

LENGTH: 327 words","


New federal rules around electronic cigarettes that ban sales to minors and
require disclosure of ingredients are practical and necessary for the
increasingly popular smokeless devices.

But local laws banning the use of e cigarettes in every place where smoking is
prohibited, such as restaurants, bars or within 20 feet of entrances, are a
premature overreaction.

Recently, Lakewood and Fort Collins applied their public smoking restrictions to
e cigarettes. Golden, Louisville, Commerce City and Durango are planning on
doing the same.

There is no dispute around the harmful effects of smoking tobacco or the
problems associated with secondhand smoke.

Battery powered e cigarettes that turn liquid nicotine into vapor emit no smoke.
Research has yet to conclude secondhand inhalation from vape equipment has ill
effects that should be the basis of public vaping bans.

A German study that looked at whether e cigarettes cause ""passive vaping"" found
virtually no quantifiable levels of the 20 volatile organic compounds present in
cigarette smoke.

The German Cancer Research Center, however, did detect the minute presence of
metals and carcinogenic chemicals in the vapors. So further study is warranted.

Part of the problem for e cigarettes is that the user may appear to be smoking,
which is why cities are enacting regulations similar to tobacco.

Colorado already bans e cig sales to anyone 18 or younger. And the federal
government would be wise to ban marketing to teens, including flavors and
colorful packaging aimed at youngsters.

Private businesses should be allowed to prohibit vaping and the practice should
be banned from government facilities. The U.S. Department of Transportation
banned vaping in 2011. Amtrak also has prohibited it.

But bars, restaurants, bingo halls, concert venues and bowling alleys should be
allowed, for the time being, to permit the practice if they want, unless further
research proves the activity dangerous to the non vaping public.

California Company Creates Medical Device that Could Change the Course of
Medicine as We Know it

LENGTH: 552  words","


New Delhi, Dec. 22 -- Alsa Refinish LLC, a California-based company, has process
and utility patent applications in place for a revolutionary medication delivery
method.

If successful, Alsa will hold patents for a device that delivers medications and
herbal preparations directly into the lungs through vaporization, or ""vaping.""
It incorporates technology used in vaporizing pens and e-cigarettes, and in
addition, adds Alsa's proprietary stationary mouth tube design. Alsa's
innovative vaporization technology advances have created devices that can
precisely measure and deliver medication.



""Vaping the drug would deliver it directly to the smallest areas of the lungs
via harmless vapor,"" explains Ike Banoun, Alsa Refinish LLC president. ""Our
patents cover vaporizing a wide array of drugs and herbal therapies. The
hypodermic needle is 400 years old. It's time it came into the non-invasive
electronic world. I bet it will be in the museums of the future.""

Alsa's device could vaporize many pharmaceutical drugs, NSAIDs, herbal
supplements and vitamins. Good pharmaceutical candidates for vaporization
include, but are not restricted to, nitroglycerin, sildenafil (Viagra),
antibiotics and active ingredients of cough syrups. Patients that have asthma or
cystic fibrosis could replace their inhalers with vaping devices to disinfect
and treat the mucus with mucolytics in their lungs. Additionally, diabetic
patients could also be delivered insulin via non-parenteral routes instead of
taking painful injections.

The drug classes listed on Alsa's patent applications include antipyretic
medications for fever reduction; NSAIDs to relieve pain, swelling and
inflammation; and both opioid and non-opioid analgesics for pain relief.
Heat-stable medications from any of these classes could potentially be
administered through vaporization. Readily available treatments like Vicks
Vaporub (active ingredients) could be delivered directly into the lungs instead
of being smeared on the chest. Also, patients could use vaping devices to inhale
therapeutic herbs in liquid form.

In addition to delivering medication through the mouth, vaporization can be used
to administer medication nasally. This method of delivering medication doesn't
pass through the stomach and liver, so it prevents loss of potency. In this way,
vaping devices have the potential to treat diseases more easily and quickly, and
to deliver analgesics for more effective pain management. Medications can also
be flavored for making them palatable and for ease in administering to children.


Alsa envisions its vaping device as an effective and low-cost vaccine delivery

Pub offers 'vaping' bar

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 113 words","


DRIFFIELD: Smokers are being offered an alternative at a local pub. The Blue
Bell in Riverhead, Driffield, is opening the area's first vaping bar.

New and regular customers can enjoy the experience of smoking in a pub without
breaking the law.

It has been licensed to sell the innovative Totally Wicked range of electronic
cigarettes, often called e-cigs.

E-cigs work by delivering small doses of flavoured nicotine through a vapour,
giving users the effect and taste of smoking without harmful effects.

Pub landlord Andy Walker said: ""Vaping allows the sensation of smoking without
breaking the law.""

The Blue Bell is holding an official vaping launch on Wednesday, October 5, at
2pm.

Missouri: Board bans e-cig sales to minors, vaping indoors

LENGTH: 717  words","

DATELINE: Salem


Multnomah County of Oregon has issued the following news release:

The Multnomah County Commissioners today unanimously voted to restrict
e-cigarettes and vaping to protect children and public health.

In a 5-0 vote, the board passed an ordinance that prohibits minors from buying
and using inhalant delivery systems, such as e-cigs and vape pens. When the law
takes effect on April 5, businesses will be prohibited from selling the devices
to people under age 18. And vaping won't be allowed in workplaces where smoking
is prohibited.

""My primary concern is protecting kids from exposure to these products,'' Chair
Deborah Kafoury said at Thursday's meeting. ""And I want to ensure that people
who choose not to vape are protected at work.""

Since November, the county has held 11 public meetings on vaping and
e-cigarettes.

The products, which have emerged in the last eight years, are marketed as an
alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes. But there is little information
about their safety. The health effects of the vapor on users and those around
them is unknown. Until the board acted, children and teens could legally
purchase and use them in Multnomah County. A key component of electronic
cigarettes, vape pens and other inhalant delivery systems is nicotine - a highly
addictive and harmful substance for developing brains.

Since last fall, Health Department staff and Chair Kafoury met city councils in
Troutdale, Fairview, Wood Village and Portland. More than 300 comments were
gathered online about the proposed regulation.

On March 5, commissioners thanked dozens of people for testifying, but said they
had to act now.

""We're not stopping adults from vaping,'' said Commissioner Loretta Smith. ""You
can still buy and vape. But what we're concerned about is lots of dollars are
put into advertising e-cigarettes and it's becoming a gateway drug to tobacco.
We're trying to protect the children. We are not trying to take your rights away
as adults.''

""We do not want to create the next generation of nicotine addicts,'' said Chair
Kafoury.

Many of those who testified at the board meeting work at vape shops or

exempt from the new rules. They said the shops often serve as vaping lounges and
are an important gathering place for people to come together, sample flavors and
learn how to use the devices.

""Whether you like it or not, the vaping industry is here to stay,'' said James
Cook of Gresham. ""We're asking for an opportunity to get local businesses
involved. Bring us to the table. No one wants to vape in church or in the movie
theater. We're asking for one thing: to let our businesses live.''

""This is not an anti-jobs bill,'' said Commissioner Diane McKeel. ""This is about
public health.''

Other users described quitting tobacco after discovering e-cigarettes at vape
shops.

""They taught me about the juices and nicotine,'' said consumer Clifford Smith.
""They allow me to bike 10 miles, vape with my friends and continue to try
different e-liquids and buy new products.''

People who use e-cigarettes, own and work at vape shops, gather outside the

e-cigarettes and moving to tobacco, and that sampling creates a threshold for
addictive products.

Commissioner Jules Bailey said he sympathized with the local vaping industry,
but said the Board was ""pursuing the precautionary principle making sure we're
protecting others from the ill effects of vaping.'

Saints sponsor blasts county council's e-cig stance

BYLINE: Andy Moffatt

LENGTH: 371  words","


An electronic cigarette manufacturer and one of Saints main sponsors has
launched a stinging attack on a county council.

Totally Wicked, who sponsor the Langtree Park side's North Stand, have
criticised a Lancashire County Council funded advertising campaign which they
believe will result in fewer smokers making the switch to vaping and many vapers
returning to smoking.

The advert in question, which is appearing on local radio stations, states:
""Have you ever used an e-cig?  Did you know they are not risk free?  Some
contain nicotine and other chemicals that can cause addiction.  We still don't
know enough about the health risks of e-cigs, so don't take the risk get the
facts.

""From the 1st of October 2015 it will be illegal for anyone under the age of 18
to buy e-cigs.  It will also be an offence for anyone over 18 to buy e-cigs on
behalf of a young person.""

The company says it fully supports the ban on the sale of electronic cigarettes
to under 18s, having voluntarily enforced their own ban on such sales since
2008.

However, the firm says it is appalled that Lancashire County Council is using
the introduction of the age of sale restrictions to also tell smokers not to
switch to vaping.

Fraser Cropper, managing director of Totally Wicked, said: ""Vaping is recognised
by all credible public health experts as being significantly less harmful than
smoking.

""There is never a situation where it is better to smoke than it is to vape.

""Lancashire County Council has to ask it selves some pretty serious questions
with regard to this radio advert.  Its tone is totally negative and almost
deliberately designed to put people off vaping.

""Who are these people that will be put off e-cigarettes?  They are current and
former smokers.  Lancashire County Council is essentially saying to these
smokers that they are better off continuing to smoke which, as every right
thinking person knows, is patently ludicrous.

""Already 2.6 million adult smokers in the UK have made the switch to vaping.

""This should be a cause for celebration rather than concern.  From a public
health standpoint, we urge Lancashire County Council to withdraw this advert at
once and issue a statement setting out the true facts surrounding vaping.""

Cut! Poldark star's e-cig habit brings filming to a halt

BYLINE: Jemma Buckley

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 361 words","


FROM his hat to his breeches, Aidan Turner looks the epitome of the 18th century
country gent as he returns to his role as Captain Ross Poldark.

Until, that is, you notice one prop that isn't exactly befitting a Cornish
squire - a large e-cigarette glued to his hand.

Turner's obsession with the 'vaping' machine has apparently disrupted filming
for the second series of the BBC period drama after it wound up in shots
supposed to portray 1790s England.

The leading man's failure to part with the device is said to have irked his
castmates - and a crew member has now been tasked with ensuring it is not in his
hand or poking out of his pocket when cameras roll.

Even fans who have flocked to Cornwall for a glimpse of the 32-year-old
heartthrob have not failed to notice his fixation with vaping, a habit often
adopted by those trying to give up traditional cigarettes.

One onlooker said: 'Aidan Turner has been using this big vaping device on set.
On sev-eral occasions when they've said ""action"" he's still had this thing in
his hand. He's never got it out of his mouth. It seems to have annoyed everyone.
He's playing the lead actor in a drama set in the 18th century... It looks a bit
stupid.

'Even when people are trying to do his make-up and get him ready he's puffing on
this thing. One time we even saw him discreetly puff the smoke out of his nose
as he walked into shot. There have been times when they've done takes and then
they'll realise he's had this thing in his hand. They'll need to reshoot the
whole thing again but rather than making it a big issue, they'll just be very
diplomatic about it.

'He used to keep it in his pocket but now it seems like he's got this girl who
comes up and takes it off him all the time.' But a BBC spokesman said: 'Aidan is
at all times professional on set and there have been no disruptions or issues
relating to an e-cigarette. We encourage him to use an e-cigarette as it is a
much better alternative to smoking. We have a very professional team who would
spot if it was in shot and of course it is not a problem during rehearsals.'
Series two of Poldark will air next year.

Why California declared vaping - e-cigarettes - a public health threat

BYLINE: Susan Abram

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 911 words","


E-cigarette use among teens and young adults escalated in 2014 over traditional
tobacco smoking in California, prompting state officials Wednesday to declare
liquid nicotine products a public health threat.

In a report and advisory released by the California Department of Public Health
, researchers found that more than twice as many 8th- and 10th-graders reported
vaping, or using e-cigarettes, than smoking traditional cigarettes in 2014.
Among seniors in high school, more than 17 percent said they used e-cigarettes
compared with 14 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes.

Most startling to health officials was the spike in calls to California Poison
Control centers related to exposures to accidental e-cigarette poisonings,
including drinking the liquid inside. There were seven calls in 2012 to poison
control. In 2014, those calls jumped to 243. More than 60 percent of all those
e-cigarette related calls involved children 5 years and under.

The report represents the toughest stance to date by California s Public Health
Director Dr. Ron Chapman, who called e-cigarettes a community threat that
erodes 25 years of tobacco cessation progress.  He said contrary to excessive
marketing that suggests vaping is a safer alternative to smoking tobacco,
e-cigarettes are not FDA-approved cessation aids.

E-cigarettes contain nicotine and other harmful chemicals, and the nicotine in
them is as addictive as the nicotine in cigarettes,  Chapman said.  There is a
lot of misinformation about e-cigarettes. That is why, as the state s health
officer, I am advising Californians to avoid the use of e-cigarettes and keep
them away from children of all ages.

While cigarette smoking has been declining nationwide, e-cigarette use has
become a $1.5 billion industry, according to some estimates. The
battery-operated devices look like cigarettes and are filled with a liquid
solution that typically contains nicotine. That  e-juice  is of concern, Chapman
said, because it is sold in a variety of candy, fruit and alcohol flavors.

He noted that e-cigarette advertising jumped more than 1,200 percent and used
marketing tactics to appeal to youth such as with cartoon characters, which is
prohibited in traditional cigarette advertising.

The availability of e-cigarettes in a variety of candy and fruit flavors such as
cotton candy, gummy bear, chocolate mint and grape makes these products highly
appealing to young children and teens,  Chapman said.  The use of marketing
terms such as  e-juice  may further mislead consumers into believing that these
products are harmless.

In response, the American Vaping Association , a trade group that advocates for
small- and medium-sized vaping and e-cigarette businesses, called the California
report misleading.

This report inappropriately paints this complex and important public health
topic as a black and white issue,  Gregory Conley, president of the American
Vaping Association, said in a statement.

Despite the health officer s false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping
helps smokers quit and is far less hazardous than smoking.

Bill Godshall, executive director of Smokefree Pennsylvania, said that by
issuing the report, Chapman  has committed public health malpractice of the
worst kind.

The California Department of Public Health is now protecting cigarettes and
threatening the lives of vapers and smokers,  Godshall said.  Nearly every
sentence in the California Department of Health s e-cig report is false or
misleading fearmongering propaganda.

Still, many cities and counties have extended tobacco bans to e-cigarettes
across California. The state has seen its overall smoking rate decrease in the
last 25 years from 50 percent to 11 percent. The Los Angeles City Council last
year voted to join New York and Chicago in banning the use of electronic
cigarettes in workplaces, restaurants and many public areas.

This week, members of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Board agreed to snuff out
e-cigarette use on its trains and stations after hearing complaints about the
vapors. A final vote is due Feb. 12.

California has only passed one state law against e-cigarettes, which bans sales
of the product to minors, but a proposed bill by Sen. Mark Leno introduced this
week would prohibit vaping in public. Chapman said there also is concern about
the vapors released by e-cigarettes. He said they do not emit a harmless water
vapor,  but an aerosol that has been found to contain at least 10 chemicals that
are on California s Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer,
birth defects or other reproductive harm.

The report also found:

Adults who reported having used e-cigarettes in a 30-day period doubled, from
1.8 percent in 2012 to 3.5 percent in 2013.

For 8- to 29-year-olds, e-cigarette use tripled in one year from 2.3 percent to
7.6 percent.

Nearly 20 percent of young adult e-cigarette users in California have never
smoked traditional cigarettes.

Chapman said the health department is launching an educational media campaign to
prevent and reduce e-cigarette use. Funding could come from the voter-approved
Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988, which instituted a tax on each
pack of cigarettes, some of which goes to California s tobacco-control efforts.

From all the evidence we have so far, e-cigarettes are not as harmful as
conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are not harmless,  Chapman said.  They
do contain nicotine. We believe that people need to know that.

Why California declared vaping - e-cigarettes - a public health threat

LENGTH: 911 words","


E-cigarette use among teens and young adults escalated in 2014 over traditional
tobacco smoking in California, prompting state officials Wednesday to declare
liquid nicotine products a public health threat.

In a report and advisory released by the California Department of Public Health
, researchers found that more than twice as many 8th- and 10th-graders reported
vaping, or using e-cigarettes, than smoking traditional cigarettes in 2014.
Among seniors in high school, more than 17 percent said they used e-cigarettes
compared with 14 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes.

Most startling to health officials was the spike in calls to California Poison
Control centers related to exposures to accidental e-cigarette poisonings,
including drinking the liquid inside. There were seven calls in 2012 to poison
control. In 2014, those calls jumped to 243. More than 60 percent of all those
e-cigarette related calls involved children 5 years and under.

The report represents the toughest stance to date by California s Public Health
Director Dr. Ron Chapman, who called e-cigarettes a community threat that
erodes 25 years of tobacco cessation progress.  He said contrary to excessive
marketing that suggests vaping is a safer alternative to smoking tobacco,
e-cigarettes are not FDA-approved cessation aids.

E-cigarettes contain nicotine and other harmful chemicals, and the nicotine in
them is as addictive as the nicotine in cigarettes,  Chapman said.  There is a
lot of misinformation about e-cigarettes. That is why, as the state s health
officer, I am advising Californians to avoid the use of e-cigarettes and keep
them away from children of all ages.

While cigarette smoking has been declining nationwide, e-cigarette use has
become a $1.5 billion industry, according to some estimates. The
battery-operated devices look like cigarettes and are filled with a liquid
solution that typically contains nicotine. That  e-juice  is of concern, Chapman
said, because it is sold in a variety of candy, fruit and alcohol flavors.

He noted that e-cigarette advertising jumped more than 1,200 percent and used
marketing tactics to appeal to youth such as with cartoon characters, which is
prohibited in traditional cigarette advertising.

The availability of e-cigarettes in a variety of candy and fruit flavors such as
cotton candy, gummy bear, chocolate mint and grape makes these products highly
appealing to young children and teens,  Chapman said.  The use of marketing
terms such as  e-juice  may further mislead consumers into believing that these
products are harmless.

In response, the American Vaping Association , a trade group that advocates for
small- and medium-sized vaping and e-cigarette businesses, called the California
report misleading.

This report inappropriately paints this complex and important public health
topic as a black and white issue,  Gregory Conley, president of the American
Vaping Association, said in a statement.

Despite the health officer s false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping
helps smokers quit and is far less hazardous than smoking.

Bill Godshall, executive director of Smokefree Pennsylvania, said that by
issuing the report, Chapman  has committed public health malpractice of the
worst kind.

The California Department of Public Health is now protecting cigarettes and
threatening the lives of vapers and smokers,  Godshall said.  Nearly every
sentence in the California Department of Health s e-cig report is false or
misleading fearmongering propaganda.

Still, many cities and counties have extended tobacco bans to e-cigarettes
across California. The state has seen its overall smoking rate decrease in the
last 25 years from 50 percent to 11 percent. The Los Angeles City Council last
year voted to join New York and Chicago in banning the use of electronic
cigarettes in workplaces, restaurants and many public areas.

This week, members of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Board agreed to snuff out
e-cigarette use on its trains and stations after hearing complaints about the
vapors. A final vote is due Feb. 12.

California has only passed one state law against e-cigarettes, which bans sales
of the product to minors, but a proposed bill by Sen. Mark Leno introduced this
week would prohibit vaping in public. Chapman said there also is concern about
the vapors released by e-cigarettes. He said they do not emit a harmless water
vapor,  but an aerosol that has been found to contain at least 10 chemicals that
are on California s Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer,
birth defects or other reproductive harm.

The report also found:

Adults who reported having used e-cigarettes in a 30-day period doubled, from
1.8 percent in 2012 to 3.5 percent in 2013.

For 8- to 29-year-olds, e-cigarette use tripled in one year from 2.3 percent to
7.6 percent.

Nearly 20 percent of young adult e-cigarette users in California have never
smoked traditional cigarettes.

Chapman said the health department is launching an educational media campaign to
prevent and reduce e-cigarette use. Funding could come from the voter-approved
Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988, which instituted a tax on each
pack of cigarettes, some of which goes to California s tobacco-control efforts.

From all the evidence we have so far, e-cigarettes are not as harmful as
conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are not harmless,  Chapman said.  They
do contain nicotine. We believe that people need to know that.

Don't vanquish vaping

LENGTH: 295 words","


Picture the archetypal French person. He or she is probably smoking,
insouciantly. About one in five French adults smokes every day and 73,000 die
each year from a related illness.

France imposed a full ban on smoking in public places in 2008. Now French Health
Minister Marsol Touraine wants to go further and make France the first European
country to ban e-cigarettes in public places.

This is a foolish idea that must not be copied in Bahrain. Figures compiled by
Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), a UK charity that campaigns against tobacco
use, show that the proportion of adult smokers using e-cigarettes has increased
six fold since 2010 - from three per cent to 18pc.

The two most frequent reasons smokers give for ""vaping"" are that it helps them
both to stop smoking and then to return to it. Yet if using e-cigarettes in
public places is banned, vapers will be driven to the smokers' sheds alongside
tobacco addicts, inevitably making them far more likely to return to using
conventional cigarettes.

A key claim used by proponents of a ban is that vaping is a gateway for young
people into conventional smoking. This is unsupported by evidence. The number of
e-cigarette users, adults and children alike, who have never smoked tobacco was
found by Ash to be ""negligible"".

In any case, it is fanciful to think that children will be driven to tobacco by
witnessing adults vaping. If anything, they will be driven to harmless vaping.

The proportion of adult smokers has halved in the past 40 years. E-cigarettes
offer a chance to wean still more people off tobacco, one of the greatest
killers of our age.

Restricting their use means forgoing a powerful way of easing the burden that
smoking-related illnesses place on health services.

We must not follow the French lead.

(Semi-)Objective Study Finds 'No Justification' for Banning E-Cigarettes
Indoors, in Public Places

BYLINE: Drew Grant

E-cig vaping (Getty)

Good news for the vaping community! A new study, produced by the environmental
health consulting firm CHANGE LLC, claims that the secondhand risks from
e-cigarette vapors are minuscule, and we should all just be chill about
co-workers using them in the office.

Study abstract:




      Comparisons of pollutant concentrations were made between e-cigarette
     vapor and tobacco smoke samples. Pollutants included VOCs, carbonyls,
     PAHs, nicotine, TSNAs, and glycols. From these results, risk analyses
     were conducted based on dilution into a 40 m3 room and standard
     toxicological data. Non-cancer risk analysis revealed ""No Significant
     Risk"" of harm to human health for vapor samples from e-liquids (A-D).



Before we get too excited, the study was contracted for $100,000 by the National
Vapers Club from solicited donations at Vaping Expos. And ""non-cancer risk
analysis"" is sort of a shady term: does that mean that checking for the risk of
cancer in secondhand vapors wasn't a factor in the study?

If we had to worry about tobacco lobbyists and spin doctors before, now we're
facing a new breed of anti-smoking, pro-vaping flack. Like the website Liberty
Flights, which has a bunch of very convincing quotes from doctors saying stuff
like:




      ""This study demonstrates that the risks of secondhand vapor from
     electronic cigarette use are very small in comparison to those
     associated with secondhand tobacco smoke. While secondhand smoke must
     be eliminated in workplaces and public places, the current data
     provide no justification for eliminating electronic cigarette use in
     these places."" -Dr. Michael Siegel of Boston University School of
     Public Health



Except that Liberty Flights is a vaping company that ""specialize[s] in quality
Electronic cigarettes and e liquids as well as other accessories such as
atomizers, cones, batteries, chargers, cases and mods."" It also refers to the
unregulated Chinese-produced nicotine liquid as ""E juice,"" which frankly sounds
a lot funner than what it actually is.

Look, we're not saying that this study is inherently biased. We're just saying
we'd feel better if there was a study presented by a lab that wasn't being paid
by an organization that has a stake in the outcome. It generally looks pretty
good for the e-cig argument, but then again, the FCC still hasn't been allowed
to conduct its own review, which keeps the relative potential risk factors in
these products pretty much a question mark.

Cut! Poldark star's e-cig habit brings filming to a halt

BYLINE: Jemma Buckley ; Harriet Sime

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 365 words","


FROM his hat to his breeches, Aidan Turner looks the epitome of the 18th century
country gent as he returns to his role as Captain Ross Poldark.

Until, that is, you notice one prop that isn't exactly befitting a Cornish
squire - a large e-cigarette glued to his hand.

Turner's obsession with the 'vaping' machine has apparently disrupted filming
for the second series of the BBC period drama after it wound up in shots
supposed to portray 1790s England.

The leading man's failure to part with the device is said to have irked his
castmates - and a crew member has now been tasked with ensuring it is not in his
hand or poking out of his pocket when cameras roll. Even fans who have flocked
to Cornwall for a glimpse of the 32-year-old heartthrob have not failed to
notice his fixation with vaping, a habit often adopted by those trying to give
up traditional cigarettes.

One onlooker said: 'Aidan Turner has been using this big vaping device on set.
On several occasions when they've said ""action"" he's still had this thing in his
hand. He's puffing on it constantly. He's never got it out of his mouth. It
seems to have annoyed everyone. He's playing the lead actor in a drama set in
the 18th century ... It looks a bit stupid.

'Even when people are trying to do his make-up and get him ready he's puffing on
this thing. One time we even saw him discreetly puff the smoke out of his nose
as he walked into shot.

'There have been times when they've done takes and then they'll realise he's had
this thing in his hand. They'll need to reshoot the whole thing again but rather
than making it a big issue, they'll just be very diplomatic about it.

'He used to keep it in his pocket but now it seems like he's got this girl who
comes up and takes it off him all the time.' But a BBC spokesman said: 'Aidan is
at all times professional on set and there have been no disruptions or issues
relating to an e-cigarette. We encourage him to use an e-cigarette as it is a
much better alternative to smoking. We have a very professional team who would
spot if it was in shot and of course it is not a problem if he uses it during
rehearsals.' Series two of Poldark will air next year.

'He's puffing on it constantly'

Pakistan: E-cigarette advertising triggers urge to smoke

LENGTH: 264  words","

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, March 14 -- Watching e-cigarette television

advertisements can make people crave for tobacco, regardless of

whether they did or did not smoke.

Researchers Erin K. Maloney, Ph.D. and Joseph N. Cappella,

Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania studied more than 800

daily, intermittent, and former smokers who watched e-cigarette

advertising, and who then took a survey to determine smoking

urges, intentions, and behaviors.

The scientists observed a trend that more daily smokers

who viewed ads with vaping smoked a tobacco cigarette during

the experiment than daily smokers who viewed ads without vaping

and daily smokers who did not view ads.

Over 35 percent of the daily smokers in the condition that

showed vaping reported having a tobacco cigarette during the study

versus 22 percent of daily smokers who saw ads without vaping, and

about 23 percent of daily smokers who did not see any advertising,

said the study published in the journal Health Communication.

They wrote that ""given the sophistication of cigarette

marketing in the past and the exponential increase in advertising

dollars allotted to e-cigarette promotion in the past year, it

should be expected that advertisements for these products created

by big tobacco companies will maximize smoking cues in their

advertisements, and if not regulated, individuals will be exposed

to much more e-cigarette advertising on a daily basis.

Vaping needs no extra protection in Oklahoma

SECTION:

LENGTH: 338 words","


Oklahoma law prevents local communities from imposing any tobacco regulation
stricter than state regulations. Efforts to allow greater local control of
tobacco have gone nowhere in the Legislature. Now, lawmakers may further reduce
local communities' power by banning their ability to regulate another product:
e-cigarettes.House Bill 3104, by state Rep.

Mike Jackson, R-Enid, would ban the sale of vaping products to those younger
than 18. But the bill also declares, ""No agency or other political subdivision
of the state, including, but not limited to, municipalities, counties or any
agency thereof, may adopt any order, ordinance, rule or regulation concerning
the sale, purchase, distribution, advertising, sampling, promotion, display,
possession, licensing, or taxation of tobacco products, alternative nicotine
products or vapor products â?¦""Oklahoma is one of only two states that
effectively ban local regulation of tobacco. Supporters of the policy claim a
hodgepodge of local ordinances would stifle business activity, particularly at
convenience stores. But there's scant evidence for that proposition in states
with local tobacco regulations. There's no reason vaping requires similar,
special treatment.At times, it's better to set policy at the state level because
the process can generate far more scrutiny and public input. But regulation of
tobacco or e-cigarettes is hardly an obscure issue. Any effort to impose local
regulations would undoubtedly draw significant public attention.Also, since it's
widely conceded that e-cigarettes are nowhere near as harmful as tobacco
products, there hasn't been a push for punitive local regulation. But even if
there were, shouldn't local citizens have the right to make those decisions?The
vaping industry loudly objects to proposals that would subject their products to
tobacco taxes, yet they want to be lumped in with tobacco when it comes to state
pre-emption of local regulations. Apparently, vaping is a tobacco product - but
only when sellers find it convenient.

topic as a black and white issue,  Gregory Conley, president of the American
Vaping Association, said in a statement.

Despite the health officer s false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping
helps smokers quit and is far less hazardous than smoking.

Bill Godshall, executive director of Smokefree Pennsylvania, said that by
issuing the report, Chapman  has committed public health malpractice of the
worst kind.

The California Department of Public Health is now protecting cigarettes and
threatening the lives of vapers and smokers,  Godshall said.  Nearly every
sentence in the California Department of Health s e-cig report is false or
misleading fearmongering propaganda.

Still, many cities and counties have extended tobacco bans to e-cigarettes
across California. The state has seen its overall smoking rate decrease in the
last 25 years from 50 percent to 11 percent. The Los Angeles City Council last
year voted to join New York and Chicago in banning the use of electronic
cigarettes in workplaces, restaurants and many public areas.

This week, members of the Bay Area Rapid Transit Board agreed to snuff out
e-cigarette use on its trains and stations after hearing complaints about the
vapors. A final vote is due Feb. 12.

California has only passed one state law against e-cigarettes, which bans sales
of the product to minors, but a proposed bill by Sen. Mark Leno introduced this
week would prohibit vaping in public. Chapman said there also is concern about
the vapors released by e-cigarettes. He said they do not emit a harmless water
vapor,  but an aerosol that has been found to contain at least 10 chemicals that
are on California s Proposition 65 list of chemicals known to cause cancer,
birth defects or other reproductive harm.

The report also found:

Adults who reported having used e-cigarettes in a 30-day period doubled, from
1.8 percent in 2012 to 3.5 percent in 2013.

For 8- to 29-year-olds, e-cigarette use tripled in one year from 2.3 percent to
7.6 percent.

Nearly 20 percent of young adult e-cigarette users in California have never
smoked traditional cigarettes.

Chapman said the health department is launching an educational media campaign to
prevent and reduce e-cigarette use. Funding could come from the voter-approved
Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988, which instituted a tax on each
pack of cigarettes, some of which goes to California s tobacco-control efforts.

From all the evidence we have so far, e-cigarettes are not as harmful as
conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are not harmless,  Chapman said.  They
do contain nicotine. We believe that people need to know that.

Hoping to snuff e-cigarette use, California declares vaping a public health
threat

BYLINE: Susan Abram

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 911 words","


E-cigarette use among teens and young adults escalated in 2014 over traditional
tobacco smoking in California, prompting state officials Wednesday to declare
liquid nicotine products a public health threat.

In a report and advisory released by the California Department of Public Health
, researchers found that more than twice as many 8th- and 10th-graders reported
vaping, or using e-cigarettes, than smoking traditional cigarettes in 2014.
Among seniors in high school, more than 17 percent said they used e-cigarettes
compared with 14 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes.

Most startling to health officials was the spike in calls to California Poison
Control centers related to exposures to accidental e-cigarette poisonings,
including drinking the liquid inside. There were seven calls in 2012 to poison
control. In 2014, those calls jumped to 243. More than 60 percent of all those
e-cigarette related calls involved children 5 years and under.

The report represents the toughest stance to date by California s Public Health
Director Dr. Ron Chapman, who called e-cigarettes a community threat that
erodes 25 years of tobacco cessation progress.  He said contrary to excessive
marketing that suggests vaping is a safer alternative to smoking tobacco,
e-cigarettes are not FDA-approved cessation aids.

E-cigarettes contain nicotine and other harmful chemicals, and the nicotine in
them is as addictive as the nicotine in cigarettes,  Chapman said.  There is a
lot of misinformation about e-cigarettes. That is why, as the state s health
officer, I am advising Californians to avoid the use of e-cigarettes and keep
them away from children of all ages.

While cigarette smoking has been declining nationwide, e-cigarette use has
become a $1.5 billion industry, according to some estimates. The
battery-operated devices look like cigarettes and are filled with a liquid
solution that typically contains nicotine. That  e-juice  is of concern, Chapman
said, because it is sold in a variety of candy, fruit and alcohol flavors.

He noted that e-cigarette advertising jumped more than 1,200 percent and used
marketing tactics to appeal to youth such as with cartoon characters, which is
prohibited in traditional cigarette advertising.

The availability of e-cigarettes in a variety of candy and fruit flavors such as
cotton candy, gummy bear, chocolate mint and grape makes these products highly
appealing to young children and teens,  Chapman said.  The use of marketing
terms such as  e-juice  may further mislead consumers into believing that these
products are harmless.

In response, the American Vaping Association , a trade group that advocates for
small- and medium-sized vaping and e-cigarette businesses, called the California
report misleading.

This report inappropriately paints this complex and important public health
topic as a black and white issue,  Gregory Conley, president of the American
Vaping Association, said in a statement.

Despite the health officer s false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping

Vapor Warehouse has 200 flavors

BYLINE: Derik Vanderford, The Union Daily Times, S.C.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 670 words","


Dec. 19--UNION -- ""Vaping"" is currently the most popular method for people who
want to stop smoking, and one new local business has been successful because of
it.

Putman residents Scott and Lacey Davis opened the Vapor Warehouse -- located at
719 North Duncan Bypass, Suite C, Union -- in September. The store offers a wide
variety of vapor supplies as well as more than 200 flavors of ""juice.""

Scott said the alternative to smoking is healthier because there is no
secondhand smoke and no tar. Customers can have their ""juice"" mixed according to
flavor and nicotine content, which ranges from 2.4 mg to .3 mg -- or in some
cases, zero nicotine. Typically, customers gradually reduce the amount of
nicotine in their mixtures.

""One person didn't want to know when they were off nicotine altogether,"" Scott
said. ""They asked me not to tell them at first, and they were off of it for over
a week before they knew.""

Scott also said vaping is allowed inside restaurants, and it leaves no smell in
hair or clothes.

""When I quit smoking, I had to throw away hats and everything because of the
smell,"" he said.

Although the FDA reported the benefits of vaping over smoking are still
inconclusive, Scott said customers can attest to the benefits. He also mentioned
that one customer came in on the recommendation of his cardiologist.

When asked the greatest benefit of going from cigarettes to vapor, two customers
in the store answered at the same time: ""Breathing!""

One customer said she smoked for 21 years, but she knew she needed to make a
change after several of her family members died of cancer.

""I hate the smell of cigarettes now,"" she said. ""Now that I've stopped smoking,
I notice the stuff non-smokers notice. There is a huge difference in the taste
of food.""

Scott also said all products sold at Vapor Warehouse are made in the U.S., and
there is no alcohol in the juice to fill equipment.

""Everything in the juice we sell can be bought in a bakery,"" Scott said.

Scott said some people vape to lose weight. With flavors such as ""Banana Split""
or ""Sugar Bear,"" which tastes like Teddy Grahams cookies, some people substitute
the vapor for desserts.

""Once you quit smoking, (vaping) is not a habit; it's a hobby,"" Scott said.

Another customer, Danny Gowan, has been coming to the Vapor Warehouse since it
opened in September. He is currently down to .3 mg of nicotine, and he considers
himself a hobbyist.

Scott said another benefit of switching is cost. One bottle of juice -- which
lasts about as long as a carton of cigarettes -- costs around $5.99.

""It's not just about money; we're here to help people,"" he said.

Scott's wife, Lacey, said she has never been a smoker, but her aunt began vaping
and is down from three packs of cigarettes a day to a half a pack of day. She
hopes to get completely off of cigarettes with the help of vaping. Lacey said
she is proud of the business.

""We hit the ground running,"" she said. ""Union has been good to us. So have
surrounding areas. We've had customers from Spartanburg, Boiling Springs,
Greenwood, and some from North Carolina.""

Lacey said she and Scott take the time to show customers how to properly operate
equipment, a courtesy which doesn't exist in some stores. The Davises also
arrange to meet people at the store when it's not open to accommodate schedules.

""In a small community, you have to work with people,"" Scott said.

Lacey said their customers have become friends and family, with some coming to
the store every day, even if it is just to hang out. She said the environment is
""kid friendly"" and has free wi-fi.

Vapor Warehouse is open 9 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Friday and from 9 a.m.-6 p.m.
Saturdays. For more information, call 864) 441-6076 or look for the Vapor
Warehouse on Facebook.

Beltrami County Board: County moving forward with vaping ban

BYLINE: Crystal Dey, The Bemidji Pioneer, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 668 words","


Nov. 06--BEMIDJI -- Vaping in Beltrami County may be going up in smoke before it
gets off the ground.

Beltrami County commissioners reviewed two proposed changes involving tobacco
licensing and smoke free public places at Tuesday's board meeting.

Beltrami County Attorney Tim Faver said the ordinances deal primarily with the
advent of e-cigarettes and electronic delivery devices (EDD). He referred to
e-cigarettes as a ""subspecies"" of EDDs.

Faver adapted the ordinances to expand the definitions of ""tobacco"" and
""smoking."" Several sections of both ordinances have modifications proposed that
would limit the distribution and legal use of EDDs in Beltrami County.

The city of Bemidji is also pursuing changes to its tobacco sales ordinance.

Ordinance 29 is the county's tobacco licensing and sales regulation ordinance,
under which any violation would be increased from a $700 fine to $1,000 with the
proposed changes.

In addition to the term ""electronic delivery device"" being interjected into many
sections, Section I of Ordinance 29 reads, ""The County further recognizes that
electronic delivery devices or e-cigarettes closely resemble and purposefully
mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale vaporized liquid nicotine or
other substances created by heat through an electronic ignition system.""

The term ""smoking"" would include inhaling or exhaling from an EDD. However,
under section F which defines ""tobacco,"" if the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) legalized the substance used in EDDs for the purpose of
tobacco cessation or other medical purposes and it was marketed as such, it
would then be legal in Beltrami County.

Ordinance 38A outlines the county's smoke free ordinance for indoor public
places and places of work.

According to the proposed changes to Ordinance 38A, the FDA has tested
e-cigarettes from two leading manufacturers and determined that detectable
levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals were present.

Bemidji has one vaping shop, Northern Vapes. Following Tuesday's meeting, owner
Matt Bewley pointed out the FDA studies referenced were from 2009.

""I just want people to make an informed decision,"" Bewley said.

The amended ordinance continues, ""E-cigarettes produce a vapor of undetermined
and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to smoke emitted by
traditional tobacco products.""

Thus far, studies have not proved nor disproved whether or not the effects of
the ""smoke"" expelled when vaping are harmful.

By revisiting the ordinances it was revealed the previous ordinance regarding
sale still included a section on vending machines which would be removed as part
of the revised ordinance.

""Since these ordinances were passed, the vending machines for cigarettes no
longer exist,"" Faver said.

Additionally, Faver proposed removing Section 4 Subd. 4 from Ordinance 38A as it
pertains to tobacco shops.

""As the ordinance currently exists, if an individual goes into a tobacco
products shop, which is defined as a place of business that derives more than 90
percent of its gross revenue from tobacco and tobacco products, it is exempted
from the restriction on smoking in public places,"" Faver said. ""The proposal is
to remove that restriction so there would be a restriction on smoking and
basically tobacco stores.""

Commissioner Jim Lucachick questioned why the provision was left in the
ordinance to allow sampling in a smoke shop.

""It allowed you to go inside and sample a cigarette or a cigar or some pipe
tobacco,"" Lucachick said. ""In a nutshell I see that as the very essence of this
whole discussion.""

""I think Commissioner Lucachick has really identified the issue with respect to
Ordinance 38A,"" Faver said.

The first reading of the ordinances passed unanimously on Tuesday. Commissioner
Tim Sumner was not present.

A second reading is planned for November 19 during a public hearing.

Rigorous tests on 'Moo Juice'

LENGTH: 698  words","

It is the adult version of a sweet shop and, while more restrictions have been
put on the use of e-cigarettes, business is booming for a new store specialising
in vaping.

Mad Cow Vaping is a brand new shop in Rainham High Street devoted solely to
e-cigarettes.

You can buy the tanks and batteries, and refills in more than 60 flavours from
strawberry ice and cherry cola to cookies and cream. But Ben also welcomes
people along for a free tea or coffee and a chat about vaping.

Owner Ben Edwards, 37, who got the name for his shop from his initials BSE,
said: ""People moan about the flavours attracting children, but seem to forget
that adults like flavours as well. Children don't have a monopoly on sweet
things and we can't be banned from enjoying anything sweet just to discourage
them.

""I quit smoking two years ago for my own children and my wife as well as myself,
I was unhealthy and started to develop a smoker's cough.

""I tried so many times to give up having been smoking for 21 years but this was
the only way I could do it.

""I've been vaping ever since. I really enjoy it. Vaping is almost like a club,
people love when the new flavours come out and it's a bit gadgety too.

""Thanks to vaping I can now run down the road, and play football with my son.""

The former web designer dreamed of starting his own firm and saw the opportunity
to combine something which has in part become a hobby, with work.

He worked all hours to renovate the shop and runs it with the help of his
marketing executive wife Louise.

However, his choice of business is a controversial one. This week Wales
introduced a public health law banning people from using e-cigarettes in
enclosed places.

Ministers argued e-cigarettes could be a gateway to tobacco and allowing free
use of them risked normalising smoking again.

But Cancer Research UK is not on board with the scheme, arguing the extra
regulations could put people off trying to quit the deadly fags in favour of tar
and tobacco-free alternatives and Mr Edwards agreed.

The father-of-two said: ""I still need the nicotine, although now I've reduced it
to the smallest amount, it's more for the habit side and the feeling of the
vapour coming our of your mouth.

""Customers are returning here already, so proud to have quit. It will be such a
shame for the government to impose bans in line with cigarettes and make their
lives more difficult when they are just trying to improve themselves.

""It will  be damaging for those looking to quit smoking. But I'm not worried
about restrictions damaging business. Vaping isn't going away, there are
2.5million e-cigarette users in the UK alone so things will carry on.""

Business is booming. With more than 30 customers a day he is already meeting his
projections for the fifth month of business - having opened just three weeks ago
- and is now looking to employ his first member of staff.

Ben Edwards imports some more unusual flavours from America but his own branded
'Moo Juice' is created in Peterborough and undergoes rigorous tests and trials
within a laboratory setting.

Little research has gone into e-cigarettes, and buying online is a risk but Mr
Edwards knows exactly what goes into his.

""There are only four base ingredients, and then the flavourings. Obviously
nicotine is not good for you, it slightly raises your heart rate but no more
than a cup of coffee.""

He does not sell to under 18s, but also said he would go a step further.

""If somebody came into my shop just wanting to take up vaping rather using it to
try and kick the smoking habit I would be very uncomfortable about serving them.

""Without question they are better than smoking, but there aren't any health
benefits so I would actively try and encourage them out of the idea.""

His client base is a mixed bag, only slightly more men than women, he has had
everyone in from nurses to an 80-year-old women wanting to give up about 60
years.

There is the standard e-cigarette which only emits a small mount of vapour, to
versions which create huge plumes of vapour.

It is calculated that, based on a smoker getting through 20 a day, by switching
to e-cigarettes they could save themselves £2,300 per year.

When Steve Smith and Douglas Cambria opened their Ronkonkoma-based vapor lounge,
Xhale Custom Vapors, in January 2014, it was one of only two vapor shops on Long
Island. Nearly a year and a half later, the market has been flooded with several
dozen e-cigarette vapor lounges permeating strip malls and shopping centers
across Long Island.

Marketing themselves primarily to smokers looking to kick the habit, vape shops
sell flavored liquids, as well as the electronic cigarettes, portable vaporizers
and other devices used to burn the e-liquid, creating a vapor that soon
dissipates into the air.

While there are thousands of flavors of e-liquids available, such as watermelon,
bubble gum and gummy bear, the nicotine content levels vary.

""We are very Starbuckish-like, very lab-esque,"" Cambria said. Customers at his
1,100-square-foot Ronkonkoma shop, or the newer Port Jefferson location that
opened in October, can choose from 170 different flavors, which can be mixed,
matched and prepared at customized nicotine levels.

""We have a mixing station and syringes,"" Cambria said, adding, ""It's a very
personalized experience. ""

Vapor lounge owners are careful to distinguish their shops from hookah bars,
where patrons share a variety of tobacco-based products using a communal hookah.

Most vaping customers, who range in age from their mid-20s to those in their 70s
and 80s, are looking to wean themselves off of nicotine, Smith said. By
initially matching the individual with an e-liquid containing a nicotine level
similar to what they've been smoking, they're able to gradually reduce their
nicotine intake without going through a withdrawal, Cambria said.

""Sixty percent of our customers came in at a high nicotine level, 18 to 24
milligrams, and are now at three or four milligrams,"" he said.

Vaping proponents tout the simulation of smoking as a healthier alternative to
tobacco. Critics - and there are many, including state and local legislators -
say vaping encourages youths and others to become addicted to nicotine.

The public health debate surrounding vaping, which is currently unregulated by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is ongoing. In 2013, New York State
banned the sale to minors of e-cigarettes and battery-powered devices used to
inhale vaporized liquid nicotine. Last year, Sen. Kemp Hannon, R-C-I-Garden
City, sponsored a bill that would have banned the sale of bottled nicotine
liquid; it passed in the Senate and died in the Assembly. Additionally, Suffolk
County currently bans e-cigarettes wherever smoking tobacco is prohibited; a
similar ban is proposed in Nassau County.

Just last week, Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone signed a law requiring
stores in the county to post warnings ""in a conspicuous place at the register""
about the dangers to children of ingesting liquid nicotine.

Cheryl Richter, co-owner of the National Vapors Club, an organization formed on
Long Island in March 2009 by a small group of vaping enthusiasts who wanted to
fight the local ban on e-cigarettes, said the ""absolute onslaught of negativity
from our governing bodies and the media"" has hampered further growth of the
industry on Long Island and across the state.

Oklahoma City has the densest population of vape shops in the country, Richter
said, noting the first shop dedicated strictly to vaping opened in southern
California in 2010. Hundreds of shops subsequently opened in the Los Angeles
area and then began moving east.

""Even though vaping was growing (in popularity on Long Island] early on, vape
shops didn't start taking off in the New York area until two years ago,"" she
said.

Richter said she sees potential for the e-cigarette and vapor lounge market to
expand and provide additional revenue, but not if regulations continue to
increase.

""In New York State, in January, 13 anti-vaping laws were proposed, from banning
flavors to taxation to licensing,"" she said. ""They are trying to lump us in with
big tobacco, which we are not. We are small business entrepreneurs. ""

Still, local vape shop owners aren't overly concerned that increasing
regulations could restrict or even close their businesses. Jeff Hirsch, owner of
Long Island Vaporium in Lake Ronkonkoma, said sales have been increasing
steadily since he opened 14 months ago. Earlier this year when Suffolk County
raised the legal age to buy tobacco products, e-cigarettes and liquid nicotine
from 19 to 21, Hirsch said he thought it might knock off some business by about
10 percent.

""It had virtually no effect,"" he said.

Jay and Chad, who asked that their last names be withheld, are owners of The
Cloud Vapor Lounge in Miller Place, which opened two weeks ago. They said they
were initially nervous about starting a business in a controversial and risky
industry.

""But, it's so big now, they can't shun us away,"" Jay said. ""It's too big, this
vaping community. It's like a phenomenon; you tell one person about it and they
tell others who want to come in and check it out. ""

In the 15 days they have been in business, 150 people looking for help to quit
smoking came through the doors, Chad said.

""On Saturday alone, we had seven new people stop in,"" he said. ""It feels good
when somebody comes into our shop to stop smoking and you send them out the door
with something that will help them. ""

Once people successfully transition from smoking to vaping, it often becomes a
social, recreational hobby, Xhale's Smith said. Once a month, Xhale features a
comedy night at its Port Jefferson location. Cambria said he foresees more local
entertainment, such as local bands or starving artists appearing at vape shops.

""In the '90s, when smoking was removed from bars, a lot of that was taken away
from us when we were smokers,"" he said.

Some vapor shops already host cloud competitions and giveaways.

""That's a very big reason this industry is moving forward at such a rapid pace,""
Smith said. ""Nine out of 10 people have success getting off cigarettes, and then
you have the 'cloud chasers' who are looking for something more. ""

In addition to the starter kits - pen-style vaporizers that cost about $30 (a
10-mililliter bottle of e-liquid runs about $9) - Xhale sells a plethora of
advanced devices, ranging in price from $100 to $700, for hobbyists, primarily
the 20-to-30-year-old crowd, looking to take a hit and blow a monster cloud.

""They are seeing, literally, a three-foot cloud coming out of their mouth,""
Smith said. ""That's another type of sale for this industry. ""

Buffalo Grove weighing stricter rules for vaping and e-cigarettes

Buffalo Grove is debating stricter regulations on e-cigarettes and vaping, in
hopes it will discourage kids from using the products.

On Wednesday, the planning and zoning commission discussed options that include
turning e-cigarette/vape shops into a special use under the zoning code,
requiring the shops be a minimum distance from schools and parks, and regulating
e-cigarettes and vaping the same as tobacco.

Village Planner Nicole Woods said in so doing, Buffalo Grove would have some of
the strictest regulations in the Northern suburbs. Only two of 15 nearby
communities surveyed require a shop to be a certain distance from schools and
parks, and in those cases the distance is relatively short -- only 100 to 150
feet. She added it wouldn't have a practical application in Buffalo Grove
anyway, ""as our schools are not immediately adjacent to any commercial
(businesses).""

Commissioner Scott Lesser said he advocates for tighter standards, especially
keeping the shops away from schools.

""I recognize that by taking this position we may be outside the norm,"" Lesser
added. ""This is a new product. I have seen its use expand exponentially among
not only adults, but kids.""

Community Development Director Christopher Stilling said the village is no
stranger to setting precedents -- its 2006 Clean Air Ordinance bans smoking
establishments like cigar lounges and hookah lounges.

""We're one of the few communities that actually has a more restrictive ordinance
than the state statute,"" he said.

However, the ordinance does not address e-cigarettes.

""This is an opportunity for us to tighten those standards, and I'm not sure
whether I would let that opportunity pass,"" Lesser added.

The village's public health commission will consider the matter Feb. 10. The
planning and zoning commission will hold a public hearing Feb. 17.

KIK E-Cigarettes will air its first vaping advertisement on national TV on the
day the new advertising rules for e-cigarettes come into force.

The new rules, revealed by the committee of advertising practice (CAP) last
month commence www.today.TV advertising for cigarettes was banned in 1965 and in
1986 all advertising showing people smoking was also banned.

In a TV landmark, KiK will be the first in the industry to show people vaping,
an action that has never been seen before on a TV commercial.

The advert will be on air until December 10 on channels including ITV, Channel 4
and Dave.

KiK chief executive Sandy Chadha said: ""The new advertising rules are a positive
step to show people how vaping can help them move away from tobacco products and
we are delighted to make history on November 10. Vaping is a new way of life for
past smokers and the advert highlights friends talking about the impact making
the change has had for them.

""We hope it is well received and gives smokers some food for thought.""

KiK said sales have increased by 163 per cent since February 2014.

Teen access to e-cigs faces scrutiny

BYLINE: brittany hans0n STAFF writer, The Orange County Register

SECTION: CHAPMAN; Pg. Cover

LENGTH: 761 words","



HIGHLIGHT: Chapman studies whether marketing has influenced the boost in '
vaping.'


As smoking of electronic cigarettes among youths rises, Chapman University
assistant professor Georgiana Bostean and her student team are studying the link
between ""vaping"" and aggressive marketing of e-cigarettes to youth, including
the proximity of smoke shops to schools.

The battery-operated penlike vape devices come in a rainbow of colors and
designs and are commonly filled with a mix of liquid nicotine and a flavor
called ""juice,"" with colorful names such as Cotton Candy Clouds and Insane Candy
Cane. The liquid formula is heated by the device and the vapor (as opposed to
smoke) is inhaled like a cigarette.

E-cigarettes essentially deliver nicotine - a stimulant - without the other
ingredients that come in regular cigarettes, such as tar and carbon monoxide.

While researchers at UC Irvine and Georgetown University, among other
universities, have found evidence that nicotine may have positive effects on an
adult brain, the effect of vaping and liquid nicotine use on the overall health
of young people is unknown.

E-cigarettes were initially marketed as a way to help smokers quit. But Bostean
suggests that youthful marketing of e-cigarettes and the high number of
unregulated specialty retailers may make young people more susceptible to
e-cigarette use.

The Centers for Disease Control reported that cigarette smoking by youth is
down, while e-cigarette use is up. The use of e-cigarettes by teenagers doubled
between 2011 and 2012, according to the CDC. More than a quarter-million youth
who had never smoked a cigarette used electronic cigarettes in 2013.

Another more recent report, by Monitoring the Future, also found that more
students in in middle school and high school are vaping than smoking.

Marketing and local restrictions

Locally, restrictions on the use of e-cigarettes vary. Seal Beach was the first
Orange County city to regulate the sales of e-cigarettes and vaping. Ordinances
adopted earlier this year treat e-cigarettes equally to traditional tobacco
products.

Mission Viejo, Aliso Viejo, Buena Park, San Clemente, Laguna Niguel, Irvine and
Costa Mesa are in line to follow suit.

Roughly one-third of Orange County 11th-graders have tried e-cigarettes,
according to the 2013-14 California Healthy Kids Survey.

The downshift in cigarette smoking by teens has been due in part to the heavy
restrictions applied to tobacco marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. Since 1971, there has been a ban on TV and radio ads for
cigarette and other tobacco products. Newer FDA regulations put tobacco products
behind store counters.

Meanwhile, there are no regulations on vaping ads. E-cigarette brands VUSE, made
by old-school cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s subsidiary R.J.
Reynolds Vapor Co., and Lorillard Technologies Inc.'s blu eCigs both advertise
on TV.

Advertising restrictions have not been applied to electronic cigarettes because
the devices don't contain tobacco, though the FDA has proposed extending its
oversight to e-cigarettes.

So far, Bostean's team has observed 22 e-cigarette retailers in Santa Ana to see
whether there's a link between proximity to schools and use of e-cigarettes.
Research team leader Nate Vorapharuek, 21, said many of the locations are within
a quarter-mile to a half-mile from schools.

There are marked differences in how traditional tobacco products are sold vs.
e-cigarettes, Bostean said. For one, e-cigarettes are more visible inside the
store and from the outside looking in. E-cigarettes are also more accessible.

""Many of the smoke shops were selling vape cigarettes on a counter, at eye level
next to the candy,"" Bostean said.

For the second half of the research, the researchers will observe Costa Mesa
retailers.

Danger inside

Because e-cigarettes, which have been around for a decade, are unregulated by
the FDA, the nicotine levels in the liquids are at the discretion of the mixer,
said student researcher Katie Henderson, 21.

Ingestion and even topical exposure to the concentrated liquid nicotine used in
home-brewed mixes can be extremely dangerous, even lethal, said Lee Cantrell,
San Diego division director of the California Poison Control System.

""Ten to 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight could be potentially lethal,""
Cantrell said.

Up to half of all the California exposure cases involving liquid nicotine are
children - 140 on record this year alone, Cantrell said.

Bostean's primary research goal is aimed at identifying social trends and
marketing influences. Next year, she plans to have students do a chemical
analysis of the liquid.

On the vaper trail: how e-liquid company Simple Vape Co is taking vaping
upmarket;
English toffee, elderflower, Pink Lady apple - these boys' e-cig flavours are
taking vaping upmarket says Susannah Butter

SECTION: LONDON LIFE

LENGTH: 737 words","


Christian Sanderson works in fashion. His neat beard and sartorial sense mark
him out as a man of up-to-the-minute taste. So when his girlfriend, Vogue
fashion features editor Laura Weir, saw him reach for an electronic cigarette he
says that she was taken aback. ""When I first vaped my girlfriend said, 'That
looks ridiculous, what are you doing?'""

That was a year ago. Sanderson, a smoker for 17 years, had resolved to give up
after a particularly wheezy cycling holiday in the Alps. ""I tried every form of
nicotine substitute then I was introduced to vapouriser pens. They made a
dramatic difference but there wasn't anything for the older, more
style-conscious demographic who want to be able to vape on the Tube without
being embarrassed,"" says the 31-year-old, puffing on a discreet black machine.
""The market was saturated with complicated brands and flavours, so you didn't
know what you were vaping.""

He had the idea for an alternative at 4am and called his childhood friend
Michael Thompson, who works in the City, about it at six. They recruited another
pal, Mario Yalias, who has a tech background, and formed Simple Vape Co, working
around their day jobs. It's going well so far. Last month they went to represent
the company at Parliament, where e cigarette legislation is being discussed as
an attempt to clear the confusion about what this technology represents.

Vaping is already allowed at the House of Commons bar and Nick Clegg is the
latest high-profile ""vapist"" (the Simple Vape Co boys claim not to have heard
the term or be aware of the derogatory connotations when it is used by smokers).

Much like a teenager encouraging his friend to try their first fag, Yalias is
keen for me to have a vape. They have brought their range along to the King's
Head members' club in Haggerston, near their office. The packaging is all clean
lines and neutral colours - suggesting that an expensive scented candle might be
inside.

Instead there are four delicate bottles of e-liquids, one for each flavour -
English toffee and banana, elderflower and pear, Pink Lady apple and French
tobacco.

They start me on elderflower, which I protest is a girly stereotype but they
tell me is a bestseller. I don't smoke and never thought I would vape, so they
adjust the vapouriser so that the nicotine dosage will be low - 3mg.

The mixture is made in a laboratory in Hampshire and has only three ingredients.
Yalias explains: ""Propylene glycol gives you the sensation that you are smoking;
vegetable glycerine carries the flavour and gives you a visual - you can see
something being emitted; and nicotine. This compares with cigarette smoke, which
contains more than 4,000 chemicals. There is a range of battery-powered
vapourisers. You fill the atomiser with liquid and press a button. It emits some
heat which vapourises the liquid.""

It hits the back of my throat in a similar way to a cigarette but with a taste
that is cleaner, slightly sweet and not at all synthetic. As I exhale, Thompson
says, ""We'll have you blowing smoke rings in no time.""

Related stories

A community has built up around vaping. ""It has become a hobby in a way that
never happened with nicotine patches or even smokers - you won't get them going,
'You must try these Marlboro Reds',"" says Thompson. Yalias describes vaping as
""a consumer-driven response to a public-health problem"". They estimate that 70
per cent of their customers are men but point out that more men smoke cigarettes
too.

Thompson is the only one of the group who has never smoked and says: ""My one
reservation was that opponents suggested that vaping was a gateway to smoking,
but we discussed it and the general consensus was that it is a gateway out. We
are in talks with Cancer Research UK about a donation scheme where we give them
a percentage of our sales. We want to support them while taking people away from
tobacco.""

Tobacco companies have noticed the potential and want in. Is there any money in
it? ""Maybe eventually,"" says Thompson. ""Now our main concern is building a
brand, which is more cash intensive. We want to make a sustainable, ethical
business.""

They have already broken America. After vaping blogger Martyn Parker reviewed
Simple Vape Co they sold out. Now Sanderson's girlfriend texts him when she sees
a model vaping and Yalias says his fiancé is ""a part-time vaper"". All that
remains is for them to convince their girlfriends to ditch the cigarettes.

Vaping offers smokers way to quit

BYLINE: Lindsey Adkison, The Brunswick News, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

Dec. 21--Justin Harrison vividly remembers his days as a heavy smoker. The habit
weighed on the Waycross native, making it difficult for him to take pleasure in
the simplest things in life.

""I had been a smoker for 20 years and I couldn't even walk my dog around the
block without huffing and puffing,"" Harrison said.

While Harrison felt the negative impacts to his own health daily, it was the
effect it was having on his family that made him want to make a change.

""My uncle, who was few years younger than my mom, died of lung cancer. He was a
smoker. I remembered thinking ... I don't want to die,"" he said.

But it was also during this time that he discovered an answer.

""After the funeral, I was with my cousins and they were all vaping. And I asked
them, I said 'what is this? Tell me more,"" he said. ""So I tried it and I got one
... started using it. Then I quit cigarettes that very same day. The last
cigarette I had was Feb. 9, 2014.""

Since putting down his cigarettes, Harrison has acquired a new lease on life. He
feels much healthier and he is able to do things we wasn't able to do in the
past.

""I go running with my dog now,"" he said with a smile.

Vaping, or using devices known as e-cigarettes, has become a popular national
trend over the past few years.

The movement has allowed many users to stop smoking traditional cigarettes which
include tar and a horde of carcinogenic compounds. Instead, vapers use a device
that heats juice or a particular flavor and produces a vapor instead of actual
smoke. Because of this, there is no second hand smoke and the vapor dissipates
in just seconds. It also doesn't cling to walls or other substances.

""There is no second hand smoke and you don't smell like a cigarette. Your
clothes, house and car don't smell like cigarettes,"" he said. ""It's really just
so much better.""

And that's only one part of the equation. Switching to a vaporizer over
cigarettes also helps cut down on the risk of developing cancer.

That's because along with tobacco cigarettes comes 7,000 chemicals, many of them
able to cause cancer. Among others are formaldehyde, used in embalming fluid,
and benzene which is also found in gasoline. Polonium 210, a radioactive
substance, is also present.

Since discovering how using a vaporizer can change lives, it's been Harrison's
goal to give that to others. That's why he first opened 912 Vapes in Waycross
over the summer of 2014. The store saw so much success that Harrison opened
another location at 109 Village at Glynn Place, which is located in the Publix
Shopping Center in Brunswick.

At both stores, however, vaping enthusiasts can buy vaporizers, try flavors of
juice used in the devices as well as purchase other accessories. Customers are
also able to converse with the knowledgeable staff, all of whom gave up
cigarettes entirely after starting to vape.

The juices themselves come in an array of flavors, with a varying level of
nicotine. Some have none at all. Harrison says that this allows vapers to
completely customize their experience.

""The devices come in all shapes and sizes. Each one has different settings and
some give you more of that cigarette feeling,'"" he said. ""And with the juices,
you have different levels of nicotine and every flavor under the sun.""

Harrison's goal was to offer something that wasn't available in the area.

""There's really nothing like this anywhere nearby. I got the idea when my
girlfriend and I were in Jacksonville and I saw a vape store. I didn't even know
what it was but I said ... let's go see what that is,"" he remembered.

Since then, he's been able to help residents of both areas give up smoking for
good. In fact, Harrison estimates that, between the two stores, he and his staff
have helped more than 5,000 people give up their cigarettes.

And that is certainly his top priority.

""Our number one goal is getting people off cigarettes,"" Harrison said.

Vaping may be a lifesaver - expert

E-CIGARETTES are unattractive to non-smokers and there is no evidence they are a
gateway to smoking, an expert has told Assembly Members.

""At the moment all vaping does is potentially save lives,"" said Professor Peter
Hajek, the co-author of a Public Health England-commissioned report which
advocated the use of the devices to help people give up smoking.

Prof Hajek told AMs he wouldn't support a ban on smoking e-cigarettes indoors
and said not liking something was not a good enough reason to stop it.

He argued there was no risk from ""passive vaping"" like there is with passive
smoking.

The Welsh Government has proposed banning e-cigarettes in enclosed public and
work spaces amid worries they normalise smoking.

But Prof Hajek, from the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, argued
e-cigarettes were not attractive to those who don't already light up and claimed
there were few young people using them who did not already smoke.

""At the moment the evidence we have is that e-cigarettes are remarkably
unattractive to nonsmokers,"" he told a meeting of the National Assembly's Health
Committee, which is investigating the Public Health Bill that includes the ban.
Nicotine by itself is not that addictive. What is addictive is cigarettes,"" he
said. He suggested non-smokers may try e-cigarettes, and added: ""That is
happening increasingly, but rather remarkably they don't progress to daily use.""

He also claimed it was ""almost impossible to find a young nonsmoker who would be
a daily vaper"".

""We have data year after year that more and more smokers believe that
e-cigarettes are harmful. That puts them off doing something which would save
their lives,"" he said.

Prof Hajek said he did not have a strong feeling about the proposed Welsh ban
but added: ""On balance I think I would vote against such a regulation.

""One reason is that e-cigarettes do not harm bystanders. The rationale we had
for banning smoking is that there is a risk of passive smoking. There is no risk
of passive smoking.

""You have the main reason taken away. It becomes a question of 'I don't like it,
so I don't want people to do it'. You get into shaky ground.

""The dictator in North Korea - if he doesn't like a certain type of haircut he
can ban it.

""If somebody doesn't like people vaping it's not a good enough reason to ban
it.""

He said he would want to see an effort to correct the ""misperception"" that
vaping and smoking were the same and instead to ""give out a message that smoking
is really bad, vaping is much safer"".

Prof Hajek's report said e-cigarettes could help reduce smokingrelated diseases
and deaths if smokers were encouraged to switch.

It claimed there was no evidence e-cigarettes were ""undermining the long-term
decline in cigarette smoking among adults and youth and may in fact be
contributing to it"".

With vaping, it's better to be safe than sorry

NEW trends and lifestyles come and go. But it looks like the addiction to
e-cigarettes is here to stay and young people are the ones who are most excited
about it.

Many smokers switch to e-cigarettes because they think it is less dangerous than
smoking.

They may be wrong. Although there has yet to be research on the dangers of
vaping, it has not been proven safe, too.

Since it is better to be safe than sorry and as prevention is better than cure,
e-cigarette addicts should stop vaping.

These two activities share similarities that explain why it is not advisable for
smokers and vapers to satisfy their cravings in eateries.

These people are not sensitive to others who may be uncomfortable with the smoke
and smell of cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

Smokers love to gather and enjoy their habit during their free time, even at
work.

The popularity of e-cigarettes has encouraged youngsters to waste their time.

Some feel that it is a must for them to puff away after they eat.

It is feared that when youth engage in vaping, they will risk changing for the
worse.

When vaping becomes their obsession, chances are they will pay less attention to
their family, career and studies.

mums-to-be warned e-cigs can harm baby;
Study finds vaping can damage the nervous system and lead to learning and memory
problems

PREGNANT women who use e-cigs may be harming their unborn babies, according to
research.

US tests suggest vaping damages the foetus's nervous system, making it as
harmful as smoking tobacco.

Scientists found it can lead to poorer learning, memory and co-ordination and a
rise in hyperactive behaviour.

It could also reduce a newborn's future sperm count and damage sperm DNA.

Two million Brits use e-cigs because they are seen as ""safe"". UK health
officials even encourage smokers to switch to vaping.

The alarming new risks were presented to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in Washington.

Lead researcher Professor Judith Zelikoff said the findings illustrated for the
first time the potential danger to the unborn child. She added: ""The perception
is that e-cigarettes are completely safe for pregnant women and infants but we
can't say that. This is ground-breaking research.

""Our studies should give pause to people who are pregnant and using these
products as an alternative.""

Her studies on mice show that - just like cigarette smoke - vaping chemicals
disrupt gene activity in the part of the brain responsible for higher mental
functions. And even e-cig vapour without nicotine caused a large number of gene
changes.

Professor Adam Balen, of the British Fertility Society, said: ""It may be best to
avoid all kinds of smoking during pregnancy.""

Tom Pruen, of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association, insisted
e-cigarettes were still ""likely to be better"" for pregnant women than smoking.

A separate study at the conference said vaping could damage the immune system,
reducing its ability to fight lung disease.

HIGHLIGHT: Ruby Vapor, a leading retailer of high-quality electronic cigarettes,
e-liquids, and accessories, has opened the doors to its new premium vaping
location at the Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg. RubyV is focused on becoming the

Electronic cigarettes' risks; non-med testosterone boost

BYLINE: Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Micahel Roizen

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 14B

LENGTH: 657 words","


Q: My 16 year old daughter is vaping. Have you heard of this?! How can I
persuade her it's not a good idea? Gretchen F., Lexington, Ky.

A: We confess, we had to do some research on this one! But after smoking out the
info, we hope we can help you persuade your teen that using electronic
cigarettes can have consequences.

For those of you who need a quick course on vaping: It's a hipster version of
smoking tobacco. Retail vaporiums sell flavored vapor cartridges with or without
nicotine. Placed in high tech gadgets with names like EGO and iTaste, the
cartridges are battery activated to produce a smokeless cloud when you inhale.

The vaping liquids are sometimes made with propylene glycol (other bases are
used, but not all companies say what they are). While the Food and Drug
Administration says propylene glycol generally is safe in personal care products
and plastics, animal research indicates that inhaling the chemical may affect
fertility and the health of offspring. You also can tell your daughter that one
study found five minutes of vaping lowers lung function as much as smoking a
conventional cigarette.

In its favor, this cloud of vapor doesn't contain the 60 known carcinogens found
in tobacco smoke, and it may be a way to kick tobacco (it works for some folks).
But as a general rule, putting anything besides relatively clean air into your
lungs can lead to a roster of complications, depending on what's inhaled. If
your daughter wants to feel hip, suggest nonpermanent, vegetable based hair
color (try red! blue!); you can live with that, and so can she, right? And for
stress relief, suggest joining an after school athletic program or practicing
yoga together. She'll learn how important it is to inhale without extra
chemicals in every breath and appreciate how much you want to help.

Q: I'm 48 and just got a prescription for testosterone therapy because I'm tired
all the time and am having trouble with my sex life. Now I hear it may be bad
for my heart. Can I raise my testosterone levels without taking my low T
medication? Steve G., Stonybrook, N.Y.

A: Although we don't know your medical history, there's a good chance you can
elevate testosterone levels and improve your sex life without your prescription.

First, you may not have clinically significant low testosterone. More than 25
percent of low T prescriptions handed out in the past few years were dispensed
without a blood test, which is the only way to know for sure. (When you get a
blood test, your free testosterone level is what's in your bloodstream and is
the important number, but many labs report only total T.)

Even if you had a blood test, minor illnesses, lack of recent exercise, the time
of day, stress or even your favorite team losing a game can cause a temporary
drop in free testosterone. So get another (or your first) blood test. If your
free testosterone level is below 200 nanograms per deciliter, that qualifies as
a deficiency. (Below 300? Repeat the test.)

Also, high blood pressure, elevated LDL cholesterol, diabetes or obesity can
cause low T levels. Improve those conditions by eliminating the Five Food Felons
and eating nine servings of produce daily, plus increasing physical activity
(aim for 10,000 steps a day). That will give every aspect of your life a boost,
including your sex life.

Using do it yourself T boosters also helps you dodge potential health risks from
testosterone supplements. A new study shows low T therapy doubles the risk of
heart attack for men over 65 and almost triples the risk for those younger, if
they have a history of heart disease.

So, to recap: The smart steps to increase your T level and improve your sex life
include improving your diet and increasing physical activity, plus limiting
alcoholic drinks to two a day, reducing stress, stopping smoking and increasing
cuddle time with your honey.

Shop capitalizes on 'vaping' rage

BYLINE: Jennifer Hall, St. Joseph News-Press, Mo.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 462 words","


Jan. 11--An alternative to smoking is becoming more popular as ""vape shops"" are
opening up all over the country. E-cigarettes, or modified electronic
cigarettes, called mods, are trendy and effective, according to their users.

""I had tried everything else to quit smoking,"" Mary Chandler said. ""This is the
only thing that has kept me from buying a pack of cigarettes.""

While cessation experts warn that e-cigarettes aren't necessarily the correct
way to quit, a recent study touts the benefits of their use. In a 2013 study
published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, 89 percent of e-cigarette users
were still ""vaping"" to quit smoking at the one-year mark. And only 6 percent had
relapsed to smoking cigarettes.

There are four main ingredients to e-liquid, one of which is nicotine. The
substance used in the devices is made up of water, propylene glycol or vegetable
glycerin, nicotine and flavoring. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
approved the individual ingredients found in e-liquid but not the combined use
of them.

Aqueous Vapor has more than 200 vapors, from tobacco and flavorless to butter
rum and berry. The vape shop opened at 2304 N. Belt Highway about four months
ago.

""If we can't find anything you want, then you probably won't like anything,""
said Dan Hathaway, manager. ""We strive to have the most options.""

Mr. Hathaway himself is a former smoker. Using the product started out as more
of a hobby than just quitting smoking, yet he hasn't touched a cigarette in more
than two years.

Vaping also could be an affordable alternative to smoking, he said. A complete
start-up kit costs about $30. After that, it's about $20 a month.

But with the electronic devices, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, the
e-cigarettes that most people are familiar with behind the counters of
convenience stores or novelty shops don't last as long as other products out
there. Their primary focus is to simply look like a cigarette, Mr. Hathaway
said.

""And there are endless kinds of systems out there,"" he said.

Aqueous is located in 18 cities, but St. Joseph is the only one with a smoking
ban that includes e-cigarettes.

Mr. Hathaway said he supports the smoking ban but wishes e-cigarettes hadn't
been included.

E-cigarettes were a $3 billion market in 2013 and St. Joseph is a popular
regional market for sales. Missouri banned e-cigarette sales to teens last year.

Only e-cigarettes that are marketed for therapeutic purposes are currently
regulated by the FDA. The agency has yet to conclude their study on
e-cigarettes, therefore many municipal smoking bans included the products.

E-cigarette users say vaping makes them feel better and stop smelling of smoke;

Vapers say switch to electronic cigarettes means they can smoke in company
without offending people and their lungs feel healthier

""It helps more with the social aspect of life than anything,"" said Elijah
Williams, manager of House of Vapes, a dimly lit east London cafe full of small
flavour phials with names ranging from Grape to OMG.

""You don't realise until you start using it around friends and they're not
bothered because it smells like strawberry.""

Users of e-cigarettes or vaping devices often talk about the change in habit
like a conversion story. Devotees say there is a culture of cool around vaping
but that there's more to the habit than style. They feel a real change to their
lives and their health as well as a release from cigarette addiction.

""I used to be quite against it because a lot of my friends were trying to get me
on to it and I didn't really see the point,"" said Williams.

""It was only when my friend got an upgrade and he gave me his old device and
said: 'Listen, you've not paid for it, it's got some liquid in it, give it a
go.' Two weeks later, I was outside on my lunch break having a cigarette. I
started using the two of them together and I just didn't like the smell of smoke
on my clothes any more.""

Williams went on to see if vaping had affected his health, a concern shared by
many when e-cigarettes first hit the shops. His doctor confirmed that his lungs
had improved since the switch. Williams added: ""I think it's more beneficial
than harmful to be honest.""

Related: E-cigarettes: is vaping any safer than old-fashioned smoke?

""As well as that, using it at home became a lot more pleasurable because I could
use it in the front room. I didn't have to go to the garden any more to have a
cigarette so I could just sit there and watch EastEnders with my mum which I'd
never really been able to do - so it's helped me socially and it's helped me
give up cigarettes as well.""

Chadia Aboutaka, a customer, said: ""I haven't done much research on it, but I
know that I feel better than I did smoking, so for me that's evidence enough.
And I know I don't want to vape for the rest of my life anyway. It's something
that I'm doing that's transitionary.

Jack Paul, a young East Midlands Trains employee from Newcastle who has recently
switched from smoking cigarettes to using a vaping device, added: ""I'm sure it's
not 100% healthy because there's always chemicals in them, but I can say I
definitely feel better than I did having cigarettes - I think they're probably
healthier.""

Quebec targets terrasse smoking, vaping in Bill 44

BYLINE: AARON DERFEL, Montreal Gazette

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 840 words","


Montreal's director of public health and anti-tobacco groups are praising the
Quebec government for tabling a proposed law Tuesday that would impose the same
limits on vaping as on smoking in public spaces, as well as banning scented and
flavoured tobacco products.

But both Dr. Richard Massé and the Coalition québécoise pourle contrôle du tabac
argued that Bill 44 does not go far enough in requiring that tobacco
manufacturers use plain packaging for their products rather than the brightly
coloured boxes that in some cases are designed to look like smartphones.

Public Health Minister Lucie Charlebois said the goals of Bill 44 are to prevent
Quebec youth from taking up vaping and smoking, protecting non-smokers from
second-hand smoke and motivating smokers to quit the habit.

""Every year in Quebec, at least 10,000 people die from illnesses associated with
tobacco use,"" Charlebois said. ""The bill we are tabling today proposes ambitious
measures that would allow Quebec to regain its place as a leader in the fight
against tobacco use.""

Bill 44 expands upon existing tobacco-control legislation adopted in 2005 which
prohibited smoking in bars, restaurants and other public spaces. The new
provisions would ban smoking in vehicles in which minors younger than 16 are
present; in common areas in buildings of two to five apartments; and outdoors on
bar or restaurant terrasses.

What's more, the use of electronic cigarettes - or battery-powered vaporizers
which produce a similar sensation to smoking - would be banned in public spaces.

""We've been waiting for something like this for a long time,"" Massé told the
Montreal Gazette. ""There are a number of things that we're happy about. Banning
the use of flavoured tobacco products is very positive and something we've
wanted for a long time - prohibiting the sale of menthol cigarettes, the
fruit-and candy-and chocolate-flavoured tobacco products that are very
attractive to young people.""

Although the purported benefits of vaping are still uncertain, Massé lauded the
Couillard government for following the ""precautionary principle"" in banning the
use of ecigarettes in indoor public spaces. ""We don't think the risks are the
same as smoking, but introducing e-cigarettes in the tobacco law, associating
vaping with smoking, is truly a good thing,"" he added.

Geneviève Bois, a medical doctor and spokesperson for the Coalition québécoise
pour le contrôle du tabac, said she's ""really pleased"" with ""all the good stuff""
in Bill 44. She added that she was heartened that e-cigarettes ""were brought
into the tobacco act,"" but not banned for adults because ""it seems (they) can be
of use for some adults in terms of cessation.""

""The only thing missing from the law is a measure regarding packaging, making
sure that there is plain packaging,"" Bois said. ""That's the only measure that is
not addressed.

We hope that is something that could be addressed better through the
parliamentary process.""

Massé agreed that Quebec should follow Australia's lead in requiring that
tobacco manufacturers sell their products in logo-and imagery-free packages in
addition to

posting warnings like ""cigarettes cause lung cancer.""

Suzanne Dubois, executive director of the Quebec division of the Canadian Cancer
Society, commended Charlebois's ""courage in putting an end to the sad strategies
of the tobacco industry,"" particularly the marketing of e-cigarettes and
flavoured tobacco products like menthol cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and water
pipe tobacco.

""Even today, too many children and adolescents take up smoking, on average at
the age of 13,"" Dubois said, calling for the adoption of the bill before summer.

Officials with Montreal-based Imperial Tobacco Canada were not available for
comment Tuesday.

Montreal bar owner Peter Sergakis, president of the Union des tenanciers des
bars du Québec, denounced in an interview with Radio-Canada what he called the
""hypocrisy"" of the government in proceeding with ""sporadic"" prohibitions of
smoking rather than completely banning the sale of all tobacco products.

Sergakis added that for someone sitting outside on a terrasse, cigarette smoke
is no less harmful than the pollution spewed from nearby cars and trucks.

Some other measures of Bill 44 include: requiring that hospitals identify rooms
where the use of medical marijuana is permitted; compelling the minister to
submit a report on the law to the National Assembly every five years; and
increasing fines for disobeying the law.

In Montreal, up to 19 per cent of the adult population smokes, although the
prevalence is as high as 25 per cent in some neighbourhoods like the Sud-Ouest
and Jeanne-Mance, Massé noted.

It's estimated that there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec. A Statistics Canada
survey found that in 2013, 21.4 per cent of the Quebec population over the age
of 12 smoked, the third highest provincial rate after Saskatchewan (22.8 per
cent) and New Brunswick (21.8 per cent).

'Vaping' law has officials and vendors at odds

BYLINE: Darrell Bellaart, Daily News

SECTION: REGION; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 385 words","


Proposed legislation that would limit the use of e-cigarettes only to those
places where smoking is permitted is heavy handed, says a Nanaimo merchant of
so-called ""vaping"" wares.

The changes were introduced as amendments to the Tobacco Control Act in the B.C.
legislature Thursday by Health Minister Terry Lake.

The news was welcomed by Nanaimo health officials, and some portions of it, such
as the ban on sales to minors, are supported by merchants. But when it comes to
restricting the use of e-cigarettes to designated smoking zones, some say it's
going to far. ""I disagree with them classifying it as a tobacco product, it
should be different,"" said Jeannine Amm, part owner of Vape250 on Terminal
Avenue.

Not all ""juice"" products - the liquids put into e-cigarettes and other vaping
devices, contain nicotine.

And unlike traditional cigarettes and cigars, which burn organic material,
e-cigarettes electronically vapourize the fluid, meaning it doesn't create the
harmful smoke associated with burning. Instead, a person using an e-cigarette
inhales a vapour mist, which users call ""vaping"" rather than smoking.

Amm said unfortunately, some users give the product a bad name, by exhaling
large clouds of the vapour in public places like malls, feeding opposition to
their use. Despite this, Amm said there are doubts to the scientific basis
reason for a ban on using the devices in public.

She said studies have found e-cigarettes do not emit the same harmful,
carcinogenic byproducts released into the atmosphere from cigarettes when they
are burned.

""I would like to see people not vaping on elementary school (grounds) or places
where children are,"" Amm said.

""But the general consensus is, second-hand vapour does not contain damaging
material, as much as second-hand smoke.""

Dr. Paul Hasselback, medical health officer for Island Health, central Island
region, called the proposed legislation ""great"" news, and that controls on where
they can be used ""is probably a good thing.""

Dr. Geoff McKee, resident medical health officer agreed.

""A lot of the concern out there is we're normalizing behaviour we know has the
potential to lead to re-introduction of tobacco (in society), and that is not
good,"" McKee said.

The legislation doesn't become law until the bill is passed.

Scientists found it can lead to poorer learning, memory and co-ordination and a
rise in  hyperactive behaviour.

It could may also reduce a newborn's sperm count and damage sperm DNA.

Two million Brits use e-cigs because they are seen as ""safe"". UK health
officials even encourage smokers to switch to vaping.

The alarming new risks were presented to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in Washington.

Lead researcher Professor Judith Zelikoff said the findings illustrated for the
first time the potential danger to the unborn child.

She added: ""The perception is that e-cigarettes are completely safe for pregnant
women and infants but we can't say that. This is ground-breaking research.

""Our studies should give pause to people who are pregnant and using these
products as an alternative.""

Her studies on mice show that - just like cigarette smoke - vaping chemicals
disrupt gene activity in the part the brain responsible for higher mental
functions. And even e-cig vapour without nicotine caused a large number of gene
changes.

Professor Adam Balen, of the British Fertility Society, said: ""It may be best to
avoid all kinds of smoking during pregnancy.""

Tom Pruen, of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association, insisted
e-cigarettes were still ""likely to be better"" for pregnant women than smoking.

A separate study at the conference said vaping could damage the immune system,
reducing its ability to fight lung disease.

VAPING'S NOT TOO COOL KID VAPING'S

SECTION: FEATURES; OPINION COLUMN; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 158 words","


I'VE never been a smoker so the compulsion to pollute one's lungs with cancerous
fumes is beyond my comprehension.

I thought the days of having to endure people blowing smoke around me in pubs,
restaurants and public transport was a thing of the past. Over the last few
weeks I've come to realise that hope was premature.

Whilst visiting someone in hospital I was stunned to see a man smoking an
e-cigarette.

Whilst the smoking of such cigarettes is to be banned in hospital grounds in
both Scotland and the Republic, no such ban is being proposed here.

Vaping is argued by those in the industry to be the healthier alternative to
smoking tobacco; many in medicine say it is anything but.

Even more worrying is the fact many believe 'vaping' acts as a bridge for young
people to progress to tobacco.

If we can stress just how un-cool the use of such devices are, we may save a
generation from the multitude of possible health risks associated with 'vaping'.

Warning: is vaping a health hazard?

Electronic cigarettes are only slowly being taken up by local nicotine addicts,
due to a regulatory minefield, and scant - and fiercely contested - evidence
about their potential health effects. JULIA MAY reports.

'We all thought 'This is going to be safer,' but it turned out not to be safe' T
he website is enticing, evoking a golden age of Marlboro Men and Virginia Slim
girls. ""We're about the adventure of living. We're the end of compromise and the
beginning of being alive."" Veppo, the US-based electronic cigarette and cigar
company with this slick website, also ships to Australia, reassuring the ""People
of Oz"" that it's legal to do so.

Veppo is just one of many overseas companies supplying Australian nicotine
e-cigarette users, or ""vapers"" (the electronic inhalers generally simulate
tobacco smoking by releasing a cloud of vapour), with the batteries, heating
elements, liquid nicotine and flavours that they need. These companies are
picking up trade where Australian companies can't because while it's legal for
individuals to import nicotine e-cigarettes from overseas, it's illegal to sell
them in Australia.

Worldwide sales of e-cigarettes are approaching $US2billion this year and are
forecast to top $10billion by 2017, according to Wells Fargo & Co. While there
are no national statistics on the local e-cigarette market or take up, it's
clear that Australian uptake of vaping has been comparatively low.

Between 1 and 2per cent of Victoria's 650,000 smokers have tried it, according
to the Victorian Smoking and Health survey.

But the e-cigarette users that Fairfax Media spoke to, via the 5500-strong
Aussie Vapers web forum, are passionate advocates. Most say they tried
e-cigarettes to kick conventional cigarettes after failing with other methods,
and vaping has enabled them to quit tobacco once and for all. They are adamant
e-cigarettes pose fewer health risks than cigarettes, providing many examples of
health improvements since quitting cigarettes and taking up vaping.

They question why, from a public health perspective, e-cigarettes should not be
freely available just as cigarettes are - not to mention nicotine patches,
inhalers and other cessation aids.

Public enemy number one for the vaping community is Simon Chapman, professor of
public health at Sydney University and a prominent tobacco control activist. He
believes if nicotine e-cigarettes were to become freely available, smoking,
which has become socially unappealing, would become ""renormalised"", undoing all
the good work done on its reduction. His concern lies particularly with young
people - to whom vaping, with its colourful paraphernalia and tasty flavours,
has been shown to appeal. Fiona Sharkie, executive director for Quit Victoria,
shares Chapman's anxieties.

It's legal for Australian retailers in some states to sell e-cigarette flavours
(""e-juice"", which comes in small, attractive vials). But they can't contain
nicotine, only flavours, which range from spices and fruit to cocktails and
desserts. On Wednesday, however, the NSW department of health issued a safety
warning, saying that 70per cent of samples tested contained ""high levels"" of
nicotine, suggesting there is an active black market in Australia. If ingested,
these could be lethal. NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant warned that
""children may find the contents of the liquids enticing"", and that there had
been reports of harm to children ingesting the liquid in Australia and a death
reported overseas.

One vaper, Mary Gordon, says: ""The fact that there is a black market [in
Australia] at all just proves that many people would prefer to buy locally from
tobacconists and market stalls and not go online to import it from overseas,
which is legal but requires a lot of information gathering.""

Another vaper, ""Marty"", says it's very hard to buy quality nicotine liquids in
Australia, which is why many vapers buy in bulk from overseas. He keeps his in a
padlocked refrigerator in a locked room. ""I have taught the children in my
family to stay away from my [e-cigarettes] and bottles, and even at a very young
age of two, they were able to comprehend that my vaping products were 'yucky
medicine',"" he says. ""However, I still worry about this all the time."" It is
outrageous, he says, that the Australian government does not allow stable,
quality nicotine e-cigarettes to be sold here. ""I am having to choose between my
health and the safety of [my] children.""

The government, some researchers and anti-smoking advocates agree there is not
enough proof e-cigarettes are safe long- term and an effective cessation tool. A
spokesman for the federal Department of Health says: ""Australian health
authorities are concerned about the use of electronic cigarettes in Australia
because of a lack of evidence on their safety and efficacy. The impact of
wide-scale use of these devices on tobacco use generally is not known, and the
outcome on the community could be harmful."" He says the Therapeutic Goods
Administration has not evaluated them as safe nor effective, and e-cigarette
manufacturers have not provided evidence they are.

The research that is available is counter- interpreted by those on both sides of
the vaping fence; indeed the conclusions of one of the most cited pieces of
research, a survey of 6000 cigarette smokers in the US, UK, Canada and
Australia, are interpreted differently by Chapman and Konstantinos Farsalinos, a
research fellow at the Onassis Cardiac Centre, Athens.

Farsalinos says: ""Every e-cigarette opponent is falsely using this study to make
the misleading conclusion that e-cigarettes did not help in quitting. The study
did not evaluate the effectiveness of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation because
it was not designed for that,"" he says. But he quotes the conclusion in the
study's abstract that ""[e-cigarettes] may have the potential to serve as a
cessation aid"".

Chapman, however, points to the text of the paper, which says that ""only 11per
cent of current [e-cigarette] users reported having quit"" over a given period.
""The legendary perils of only reading the abstract,"" he says.

Farsalinos revealed to Fairfax Media this week the preliminary - and as yet not
peer-reviewed - results of the largest global survey of vapers. His online
survey, of 19,500 e-cigarette users who were motivated to quit, was designed to
study the characteristics, patterns of use, reported benefits and side-effects
of e-cigarettes, not cessation rates, but it did find that a staggering 81per
cent had quit tobacco altogether - with the median time since the last cigarette
being seven months. The remaining 19per cent reported reducing their tobacco
consumption from 20 cigarettes per day to a median four. Farsalinos openly
admits the study was funded by an e-cigarette advocacy group, with contributions
from manufacturers. He says the cessation results cannot be extrapolated to the
broader community, because it was self- selecting rather than randomised. But he
argues: ""[Saying] e-cigarettes are ineffective is a denial of reality. Hundreds
of thousands of smokers or more, from all over the world, have quit smoking with
the use of e-cigarettes.""

Chapman says studying people who have quit tobacco using e-cigarettes needs to
be done using controlled - randomised - cohorts rather than self-selecting
groups.

He also questions how respondents were recruited: ""If through vaping blogs, this
is like surveying people who belong to whisky on-line discussion groups and
pretending that they are representative of everyone who has a bottle of Scotch
in their drinks cabinet.""

Quit doesn't count someone as having stopped smoking until they have ceased for
a year.

Sharkie says, ""By the author's own admission, this study is not representative
and the fact it was funded [in part] by e-cigarette companies is also
concerning.""

She points to a New Zealand study that found vaping was only marginally more
helpful - at 7percent - than nicotine patches in helping people to quit.

She worries about the lack of evidence about long-term effects of the chemical
interaction of nicotine and flavoured liquids, recalling the introduction of
low- tar ""Light"" and ""Mild"" cigarettes. ""We all thought 'This is going to be
safer,' but it turned out not to be safe. We started to see new diseases such as
lower lung cancers because people were dragging more heavily,"" she says.

Chapman is also concerned that rather than encouraging people to quit smoking
vaping enables smokers to get a nicotine hit in places where they can't smoke:
""Most people don't quit; they use both.""

But these arguments, and many others, are rebuffed by committed vapers, for whom
the proof is in the puffing. As Gordon says, ""Going from e-cigs to cigarettes
would be like going from Kool Mints to mothballs.""

Mum's anger over vaping' shop opening

LENGTH: 287  words","


A MUM has spoken of her fears over plans to open a new e-cigarette shop close to
a school.

Claire Marsh is worried that pupils on their way to Purbrook Park School may be
tempted to take up vaping' - smoking e-cigarettes.

The cigarette substitutes are used by people trying to give up smoking. But they
still contain nicotine and are available in a wide range of colours and styles.

A sign has gone up on a shop in London Road, close to the junction of Lansdown
Avenue, although it has not opened.

Mrs Marsh said: A number of pupils will be exposed to the temptation of nicotine
addiction in the form of vaping, just like the poor youngsters of the 1940s and
1950s who were told smoking was ""cool"" and ""safe"".

Is it appropriate in this health-conscious society?

After all, the laws we now have to stop traditional cigarettes advertising, to
curb the nicotine cravings of smokers.

Why is it now okay to advertise nicotine in a different format?

Have we as a society learnt nothing from the problems of nicotine addiction?

Our NHS is overwhelmed by smoking issues.

Who is to say that vaping will not become the social leper that smoking became?

It can't be responsible to allow new businesses of this nature to be situated so
close to young impressionable adults.'

But Councillor Mike Cheshire, leader of Havant Borough Council, said the
authority's hands were tied. I do sympathise with Mrs Marsh,' he said.

Young people have enough distractions.

If a retailer breaks the law then we can do something about it. But if they are
acting legally I'm afraid we can't.'

Research is still being conducted on whether vaping poses a risk to health. You
must be over 18 to buy them.

The News was unable to track down the owner of the shop.

AS the son of parents who died of smoking-related diseases, I am pleased that
alternatives to cigarettes are available to help smokers give up, such as
nicotine patches and e-cigs.

While electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are a welcome addition to the
tobacco alternatives, the vapour produced by 'vaping' e-cigs are not.

Vapour-producing e-cigs are a cause for concern from a health and social
acceptance point of view. I've witnessed rows regarding the ambiguity over their
use in public spaces.

Smoke is a natural, although unhealthy and socially unacceptable by-product of
smoking tobacco. To allow a different policy for vapourproducing e-cigarettes
creates its own problems. Claims that 'vaping' normalises smoking are also
valid.

Recent reports are emerging that indicate that young people are taking up '
vaping' and building a dependency on nicotine while never having smoked tobacco.
This may suit the e-cigarette manufacturers and retailers as it guarantees a
sustainable market. The UK governments need to act now and implement the same
restrictions on 'vaping' as on tobacco. The vapour is unnecessary as alternative
nicotine delivery systems including non-vapour e-cigs exist for those trying to
give up nicotine.

E-cigarette users must heed manufacturers' instructions

SECTION: Pg. 7

LENGTH: 254 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: Electronic cigarettes and vaping devices can be injurious if
safety precautions are not adhered to.

E-cigarette users must follow the instructions given by manufacturers and follow
safety requirements to avoid mechanical damage which can result in injury.

Malaysian E Vaporisers and Tobacco Alternative Association (Mevta) president
Allan Foo said most vaping devices have a security chip which prevented the
device from overheating.

""When the device was introduced, most manufacturers included a security chip
which automatically switched off the device after it was pressed for more than
15 seconds.

""There are also other safety features, but are the users adhering to them? They
must remember to switch off their device when it is not in use for a long
period.""

Foo said, however, that some manufacturers sold substandard vaping devices which
lacked safety features.

""These devices are cheaper. They, however, pose a risk to users as they do not
come with the security chip.""

Foo said electronic smoking devices should be placed in proper storage to
prevent them from coming into contact with keys, coins or other metal elements
which could lead to conductivity and device malfunction.

A spokesman of Vape Empire said vaping devices and other electronic devices
would malfunction if not properly taken care of.

""Users must follow manufacturer's instructions. Never overcharge the device. It
is better to turn everything off completely if the device is to be placed in an
enclosed space for a prolonged period.""

If people choose to smoke, vape or drink too much that should be up to them;
Confusion lies at the heart of public health policy. People must be allowed to
make unhealthy choices - not kept well whether they like it or not

BYLINE: Dave Clements

How the headlines have changed: British smokers urged to start vaping by health
officials ; E-cigarettes 'should be prescribed on the NHS'. An expert
independent evidence review from Public Health England (PHE), recognises that
e-cigarettes are not only practically harmless, they are already helping people
to give up smoking and are, to quote the author of the review, a ""game changer""
for the public's health.

Vaping, says the review, is 95% safer than smoking cigarettes. Who could object
to the view that smokers be encouraged to get vaping, especially if they are
already thinking of giving up what is well understood to be a bad habit?

But the World Health Organisation and European Union are set on banning
e-cigarettes, and just a couple of months ago the Welsh government announced it
wanted to ban e-cigarettes in enclosed spaces, arguing that they act as a
""gateway"" to the tobacco-filled variety. These dubious claims - rubbished in
PHE's review of the evidence - have been used to justify threatened clampdowns.

Meanwhile in Britain, something like 2.5 million smokers have taken the lead by
switching to this much safer alternative. In other words, they have proved more
adept at looking after their own health than those charged with the public's
health. As many as half a million smokers, according to Ash, have switched in
the last year alone. On the face of it, a section of the public health
establishment has come to its senses and followed suit.

But while making e-cigarettes available on prescription is quite a turnaround,
it is more in keeping with the urge to regulate than to promote smokers' health.
Indeed this new-found enthusiasm for vaping is as likely to raise prices, as
e-cigarettes acquire medicinal status, as help smokers do what they are already
doing anyway.

The case of vaping is not atypical of a confusion at the heart of health policy.
On the one hand, promoting people's ""independence, choice and control"" has
become a mantra in health (and social care) circles. On the other, the
assumption that the public cannot be trusted to make even the most basic
decisions about how they live their everyday lives dominates public health
thinking. As one GP pleaded recently, her waiting room of patients is already
impossibly demanding without also ""trying to remember that [she's] meant to tell
smokers to stop smoking, drinkers to stop drinking, and to wave a wand at
obesity"" too. And that's just three items on a very long list.

Hasn't general practice got enough to do without having to prescribe
e-cigarettes as well? The controversy over vaping is just one of many instances
where public health dogmatism is coming up against people's autonomy. With the
exception of GPs helping those patients who need it to manage a long-term
condition, or to prevent one getting worse, are the lifestyles of patients
really anybody else's business?

It is one thing to rightly insist that the NHS change from being a ""sickness
service"" that reacts rather than prevents (reducing infections, preventing falls
and avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions). It is quite another to insist
that people must be kept well whether they like it or not. The health service is
supposed to be in the business of promoting, not robbing people of, their
capacity to run their own lives - and that means recognising their ability to
make unhealthy choices.

There is a contradiction at the heart of the policy agenda, where a rhetorical
commitment to patient choice turns out to be fatally compromised by a
paternalism that the health service claims to have abandoned. Patronising people
and protecting them from themselves just won't wash anymore. If we choose to
smoke or vape, or drink or eat too much, that should be up to us.

Shops say only big firms will survive

SECTION: G,G; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 835 words","


LOS ANGELES - Alchemy E-lixirs is tucked away on a gritty street littered with
rusted lowriders waiting for repairs at an auto shop.

But walk inside the Los Angeles-area company and you'll see a tidy new
laboratory complete with beakers, stainless-steel tables and bottles of colorful
liquid resembling snow cone syrup. The liquid is flavored nicotine, worth upward
of $40,000 a batch.

Alchemy E-lixirs owners Hooman Atefyekta and Robert Steed have spent thousands
of dollars creating the lab, which supplies their two Vapeplace stores with
liquid nicotine brews. Customers heat these concoctions with battery-operated
devices and inhale the vapors - hence the term ""vaping.""

Atefyekta and Steed's efforts at quality control, however, might not be enough
to keep them in business.

Thousands of vaping businesses across the nation face an uncertain future as the
Food and Drug Administration considers how to regulate the fledgling industry.

With its thousands of brands of liquid nicotine packs and accessories, the
fast-growing industry has had free rein to operate without regard for consumer
safety, the FDA says. Alarmed by a surge in nicotine poisonings and the
potential for abuse by children, the FDA has started the process of drawing up
rules.

If the FDA deems liquid nicotine a tobacco product, as expected by the end of
the year, companies would be required to submit applications detailing
ingredients, potential health effects and how each product is manufactured.

The process would be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, vaping shops
say - and could put them out of business.

Small companies like Alchemy E-lixirs ""don't have a chance in hell of being able
to raise the venture capital to be able to do that,"" said Greg Conley, president
of the American Vaping Association, an industry trade group.

Conley said an FDA crackdown could eliminate as many as 99 percent of the small
businesses in the vaping industry. The companies best positioned to survive are
the tobacco giants that produce rival e-cigarettes.

E-cigarettes also use liquid nicotine and face FDA regulation, but Altria Group
Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Reynolds American Inc. have vastly more financial
resources to meet the FDA's requirements.

""Making the claim that they are proposing the regulations the way they are
written to make a safer product, knowing that the only people who are going to
be able to compete is big tobacco, is ludicrous,"" said Richard Henning,
president of Nicvape, a liquid nicotine wholesaler that supplies about 675
retail locations across the nation. He worries that FDA regulation will put his
company out of business.

E-cigarettes, which use a closed-cartridge system, cannot be refilled with
liquid nicotine once the cartridges run out. They have been losing ground to the
personal vaporizers sold at vaping shops and online. Those devices are more
expensive but can be refilled with an endless variety of flavors with names like
Unicorn Vomit, Fruity Fun Cereal and Stoned Smurf.

Both devices use batteries to heat liquid nicotine, converting it to an
inhalable vapor.

Personal vaporizers account for $2 billion of the $3.5 billion in sales the
vaping industry is expected to generate in 2015, according to Wells Fargo
Securities. E-cigarettes account for the rest.

The FDA said increases in nicotine poisonings reported by poison control centers
and emergency rooms show that rules are needed. According to the American
Association of Poison Control Centers, toxic exposures from e-cigarette devices
and liquid nicotine increased from 271 in 2011 to more than 3,500 in 2014.

Studies also show that youths are choosing electronic devices over cigarettes.

Data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention released this year found that 3.9 percent of students in grades 6
through 8 were using electronic devices - well above the 2.5 percent rate for
traditional cigarettes. The study also showed that 13.4 percent of high school
students reported using e-cigarettes and vaping devices, compared with 9.4
percent who smoked cigarettes.

Liquid nicotine is still made with tobacco leaves, however. It takes Alchemy
E-lixirs about a week to manufacture a batch of liquid nicotine. First, the
nicotine is extracted from tobacco leaves that are distilled through heated
liquid.

The nicotine is then mixed with various flavors and sits for a few days to fully
blend. From there, the liquid nicotine is packaged and sent to Alchemy E-lixirs'
Vapeplace shops for sale.

The FDA said nicotine manufacturing firms will have two years from the date the
new regulations are adopted to comply with new rules.

Despite the uncertainty, Alchemy E-lixirs co-owner Atefyekta says he's trying to
stay positive about the future of the business that he and Steed built from
scratch three years ago.

""If it comes, it comes,"" Steed said of FDA regulation. ""We'll test the waters
and probably be out of business, and our 17 employees would have no jobs. Every
one of us has a share in this thing.""

Terengganu to announce decision today

KUALA TERENGGANU: Today will be the decision day in Terengganu on vaping or
electronic cigarettes.

The decision will be made after the state mufti announces a fatwa (edict).

Terengganu Fatwa Council would jointly make a decision.

He said if the Terengganu Islamic Religious Department decided to ban vaping in
the state, the Terengganu Entrepreneur Development Foundation would call for a
dialogue with vape traders.

""The state government will find a solution to the matter so that vape traders
are not affected.

""At the same time, we will find alternative ways for traders to sell other
products that are not harmful to health.""

Earlier this month, Razif announced that the state government had frozen the
issuance of new business licences for vape traders from Jan 1, in line with the
action taken by Kelantan, Johor and Kuala Lumpur City Hall.

The existing vape traders were allowed to conduct their businesses until a
decision was reached.

In August, the Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim) had banned
vaping.

On Dec 22, Deputy Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahaya said Putrajaya
would not ban vaping despite the National Fatwa Council's edict a day earlier
declaring e-cigarettes as haram (forbidden).

He said the cabinet had decided that regulating the sale of vape products was
sufficient until the ministry decided on the next course of action.

The sale of vape products fall under the purview of local governments.

The National Fatwa Council reached its decision after a muzakarah, taking into
consideration Syariah law and the results of medical and scientific studies.

On Oct 30, Health Minister Datuk Seri S. Subramaniam said the cabinet had
decided to regulate vaping due to health concerns.

Kicking it electronically;
Idaho Vape offers e-cigarettes, other goodies to quit smoking

BYLINE: By KIRSTEN JOHNSON,

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 615 words","


For smokers looking to quit, Cameron Busch, Dan Nelson and Jesse Farrer say
they've got just the answer.

The trio are co-owners of Idaho Vape, an Ammon-based, specialty vaping store
that sells all things electronic cigarettes. Its shelves are lined with tanks,
batteries, chargers, starter kits, accessories and flavorings - all the
necessities required to vape, which refers to inhaling vapor from an
e-cigarette.

Since opening in August, business has exploded. In a typical day, the tiny shop,
nestled in the Sand Creek Plaza near Walmart, will see up to 60 customers - a
number that grows each month.

""""Basically, everyone is looking for a healthier lifestyle,"""" Busch said. """"
Vaping is one of the ways people can get themselves off cigarettes without
losing everything they like about smoking.""""

E-cigs, which consist of a metal tank powered with a rechargeable battery, are
filled with liquid flavoring, available at Idaho Vape in varieties ranging from
blue raspberry to cinnamon to Turkish flavor. The flavoring contains nicotine
but without the carcinogens found in a typical cigarette, Busch said. The e-cig
habit offers smokers trying to quit enough of a nicotine fix to appease their
cravings, he said.

Busch and Nelson, both ex-smokers, decided to open the store with Farrer as a
way to help others quit. The trio attended Madison High School in Rexburg
together years before going into business. When Busch left for college in Boise,
he remembered seeing vaping stores spring up left and right. Adding one to the
vicinity of his old stomping grounds seemed long overdue.

""""There was nothing like that at the time in Idaho Falls,"""" he said. """"It seems
like Idaho Falls sometimes gets left out on stuff like this. No one really
looked at Idaho Falls as an opportunity.""""

The three old friends got together and conducted months of research about
purchasing top products, carefully researching state legal standards and working
to attract business by word-of-mouth in the local smoking community. The hard
work paid off.

""""We've had several people who've smoked for 25 years-plus and haven't gone back
to a cigarette since we opened,"""" Busch said. """"That makes me really happy
because I know how hard it is to quit smoking.""""

Idaho Falls resident Billy Brown, a regular at Idaho Vape, smoked for 14 years
before switching to vaping roughly two years ago.

""""The toughest part about quitting (smoking) is just the addiction to the
tobacco,"""" he said. """"You're not only addicted to the nicotine, you're addicted
to all the chemicals and crap they put inside the cigarettes. Vaping helped me
to where I could absolutely put it down. I still wanted a cigarette, but vaping
took the edge off it, where I was eventually able to get off it completely.""""

Brown visits the Ammon vape shop a few times each week for all his e-cigarette
needs, he said, mostly because the three who run the shop are easy-going and
friendly.

""""It's all honesty and there's no BS going on with those guys,"""" he said. """"It's
a legit store. They're really amazing and they'll really do anything to help
me.""""

Farrer said his favorite part about the business is simply spending the better
part of each day around his closest friends.

""""It's kind of nice not to have a 'boss'"""" he said. """"It's a really nice work
environment, we're all on the same page with everything. We get people (who)
come in all the time asking if we're hiring. Everyone's like, 'Oh, I wish I had
this job. You just get to sit around and vape all day.' """"

Adult Smoking Rate in Wisconsin at Record Low

LENGTH: 396 words","

DATELINE: India


India, Dec. 9 -- More adults in Wisconsin are kicking the smoking habit.

That's according to a study from the Wisconsin Department of Health, which shows
the state's adult smoking rate at 18 percent. That's 2 percent less than in
2012, and about on par with the national average.

Paul White is just one of those adults. He says he used tobacco for most of his
life, and but broke the habit through vaping-inhaling and exhaling the vapor
produced by an electronic cigarette or similar device. He started out with
e-cigarettes, and now uses vaporizer pens.

""I was still craving the Nicotene,"" White explained. ""I was more concerned with
my lungs, and the carcinogens that you get from combustible tobacco.""

Health experts say the current adult smoking rate is proof that prevention
programs and efforts are making a difference, while tobacco stores say more
people like White are switching to alternatives like vaping.

""Since we've opened a year ago, the volume of customers has increased all the
time,"" Rib Mountain Tobacco and Liquor employee Alyson Schalow said. ""As long as
people want to make the switch to an alternative like vaping, it's been
successful.""

Many users see vaping as a cheaper, healthier alternative to cigarette use. But
Marathon County Department of Health Public Health Educator Destinee Coenan says
they may be doing more harm than good.

""What we know is that there are risks associated with them,"" Coenan said. ""And
we know there are 10 known carcinogens found in e-cigarettes. However, we don't
know the long-term effective use of these, so we really don't know in 10 years
what the health effects are.""

She recommends talking to a health care provider about a quitting plan, or even
counseling.

""Quitting is one of the hardest things for people who smoke. We know it can take
many attempts, but if they have a quit plan and some counseling or anything else
that they might need, they'll be more successful,"" Coenan said.

White says he plans on slowly decreasing his vaping to eventually quit Nicotene
altogether.

""These are giving me the satisfaction that I require to make the steps,"" White
said. ""I like to think that I'm doing it as a step-down method for my health.""

Ban on electronic cigarettes and vaping delayed

SECTION: CITY &; REGION; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 201 words","

DATELINE: TORONTO


Ontario's Liberal government is delaying plans to ban vaping and the use of
electronic cigarettes in public places.

The ban on e-cigarettes in public spaces and workplaces was supposed to go into
effect Jan. 1, but Associate Health Minister Dipika Damerla says it will be
delayed until later in the year.

She says the ban on selling ecigarettes to minors under the age of 19 will go
into force Jan. 1, but not the regulation limiting where adults can and cannot
use them.

The government promised to review regulations around where marijuana can and
cannot be vaped in November, just one day after an exemption for medical
marijuana users to the vaporizing law came to light.

Damerla says the government has decided to bring in all the regulations around
vaping at the same time, which is why the ban in public places is being delayed.

Until the ban is enacted, employers and restaurant owners can still ban medical
marijuana users from vaporizing on their premises.

The regulations define a vaporizer as an electronic cigarette or other device
that contains a power source and an element designed to heat a substance to
produce a vapour to be inhaled. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015 Postmedia Network Inc. All

'Vaping' gray area

BYLINE: Richard mullins; Tribune staff

LENGTH: 1110 words","

DATELINE: TAMPA



HIGHLIGHT: Four guys at the Charley's Steakhouse sat eating their dinner and
puffing away on e-cigarettes, creating a waft and cloud of vapor. The restaurant
managers allowed it, but then made a policy against it after the Tribune asked.
It's like that with e-cigarettes lately. Name an approach and hotels and
restaurants are taking it: Some prohibit e-cigs, some allow them, some ask
""what's an electronic cigarette?""


Some places allow e-cig use; some won't say

The four men sat at Charley's Steak House, having dinner and puffing away on
electronic cigarettes, creating a wafting cloud of smokelike vapor in the dining
room.

Only they weren't technically smoking. They were vaping (a play on the word
vapor), and that was perfectly fine with the restaurant managers, at least for a
short time. After the Tribune called the restaurant's owners, Charley's set a
formal policy against e-cigarettes.

I would not have thought someone would even elect to use one inside, said Seth
Miller, senior operating partner for Talk of the Town Restaurant Group, which
operates Charley's. Still, it's a vapor, and so I called and spoke to the
general manager, and we decided it's not something we're going to allow now.

Miller wasn't taking a stand on the health aspects of vaping, rather merely
trying to balance the interests of many customers versus a few who might want to
vape. My feeling is that if anything can be intrusive on a guest experience,
it's not something we're going to recommend in our restaurants.

E-cigarette rules are like that lately. Restaurants, hotels and malls in the
Tampa region have policies all over the map.

An unscientific survey by the Tribune found companies such as Hyatt, Westin,
McDonald's and WestShore Plaza mall all have different rules. Some ban
e-cigarette use outright. Others permit them. Others haven't made up their minds
yet, and some didn't want to take a public position. Cities such as Chicago and
Los Angeles are moving to ban them in public spaces. Tampa's main airport allows
them, but some airline lounges inside don't.

[#x2756] [#x2756] [#x2756]

Electronic cigarettes don't burn tobacco. Rather they use a small battery and
cartridges of nicotine-infused fluid. A small heater vaporizes the fluid,
allowing the user to inhale their fix of nicotine, ostensibly without the health
risk from burning tobacco. Whereas smoking long has been banned from most public
places - in part because of the risks of secondhand smoke - e-cigarettes exist
in a regulatory gray area at the moment. Some federal agencies have sought to
regulate them as a drug, and some states limit purchases to those 18 or older,
but e-cigarette kits are readily available online.

That has helped make vaping a major cultural phenomenon.

E-cigarette makers such as White Cloud and Blu are becoming national brand names
and advertise in major magazines. Vaping festivals are starting to pop up across
the country, with one formally organized by Vapefest.com . A few cities now have
special vaping lounges that cater particularly to the e-cigarette crowd.

The Tampa area has scores of e-cigarette retail outlets. The Lizard Juice brand
now has a dozen kiosk or storefront locations from St. Petersburg to Lakeland.

I'm one week away from one year since I quit smoking, said Ben Bevilacqua,
manager of the new Lizard Juice retail store on West Kennedy Boulevard and a
regular e-cigarette user. I was a one-pack-a-day smoker. I've never felt better.
Just the smell of cigarette smoke makes me sick now.

By far, the most popular e-cigarette setup they sell is the starter kit: Two
fluid tanks, a battery, a charger and vaping tube. Price: $45.  There's even a
USB charging port so users can recharge their e-cig batteries from their
computer or in-car charger. E-cigarettes, meanwhile, have evolved beyond the
lookalike versions, and many now resemble almost hookahlike pipes.

E-cigarette juice from Lizard Juice now comes in a wide variety of flavors: rum
punch, spearmint, Berry Blast, jolly rancher apple and tiramisu that is heaven
in your mouth, the brochure reads. Elegant, creamy Italian custard treat that's
not too sweet.

Hotels, restaurants and other venues have all sorts of attitudes on
e-cigarettes.

The new Ducky's sports lounge allows e-cigarette use, but only on the outside
open-air deck. WestShore Plaza and International Plaza malls also allow
customers to use them inside. But Ciccio's Restaurant Group locations prohibit
them, primarily because they don't match the company's healthy living focus,
said Matthew Lanza, a partner in the company. Tampa General Hospital and the
Boca restaurant also ban them. The Westin hotel on Courtney Campbell Causeway
prohibits guests from using them anywhere, and guests could risk a fine for
using them in nonsmoking rooms. The Starwood Hotels and Resorts company
considers e-cigarettes the same as tobacco cigarettes and prohibits them.

Tampa International Airport bans traditional cigarette use inside but allows -
for now - e-cigarette use inside, and airlines such as Delta prohibit them in
their first-class lounges.

[#x2756] [#x2756] [#x2756]

Several venues fall somewhere between yes and no.

McDonald's formally has no policy on customers using e-cigarettes in their
company-owned locations and leaves the decision up to individual franchise
operators. Hyatt Hotels Corp. has no policy on e-cigarette use in lobbies or
rooms. Bern's Steak House officials formally gave a no comment on the whole
topic.

The Marriott Waterside has no corporate directive yet. I've walked through the
lobby before and seen a table of guys using them, General Manager Ron McAnaugh
said. There was a huge white poof, then it was gone. ... It's good that they
weren't smoking, but if you put 10 of them together it can be something.

In theory, he said, a guest could risk a $250 recovery fee for leaving an
e-cigarette odor in a room.

Soon, the decision may be taken out of their hands altogether. Los Angeles last
week passed restrictions on e-cigarette use in public places, joining Chicago,
Boston and New York City. Tampa so far has no formal policy or city code on
e-cigarette use.

A bill is moving quickly through the Florida Senate that would ban any store
from selling e-cigarettes to anyone younger than 18.

Meanwhile, many e-cigarette makers promote them in part as a healthier
alternative to tobacco use. The Food and Drug Administration has other opinions.
They turn chemicals, including highly addictive nicotine, into an aerosol that
is inhaled by the user, the FDA states on its public education website about
e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes have not been fully studied so consumers currently
don't know: The potential risks of e-cigarettes when used as intended, how much
nicotine or other potentially harmful chemicals are being inhaled during use, or
if there are any benefits associated with using these products.

By way of warning would-be vapers, the FDA recently posted hundreds of reports
from individuals suffering reactions to e-cigarettes. Among the problems:
pneumonia, congestive heart failure, disorientation and seizures.

Pennsylvania: E-Cigarette Advertising Makes One Crave ...Tobacco?

LENGTH: 210  words","

DATELINE: Harrisburg


Annenberg School for Communication, The State of Pennsylvania has issued the
following news release:

Television advertisements for e-cigarettes may be enticing current and even
former tobacco smokers to reach for another cigarette.

That is the finding by researchers Erin K. Maloney, Ph.D. and Joseph N.
Cappella, Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for
Communication, as reported in the journal Health Communication (online, March
2015).

The researchers studied more than 800 daily, intermittent, and former smokers
who watched e-cigarette advertising, and who then took a survey to determine
smoking urges, intentions, and behaviors.

Using a standard test to measure the urge to smoke a cigarette, people who smoke
tobacco cigarettes daily and who watched e-cigarette advertisements with someone
inhaling or holding an e-cigarette (aka vaping) showed a greater urge to smoke
than regular smokers who did not see the vaping. Former smokers who watched
e-cigarette advertisements with vaping had less confidence that they could
refrain from smoking tobacco cigarettes than former smokers seeing e-cigarette
ads without vaping.

Costa Mesa bans vaping in public parks, regulates smoking lounges

BYLINE: BY JORDAN GRAHAM, STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CURRENTCM; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 304 words","


It soon will be illegal to smoke an electronic cigarette in Costa Mesa parks.

The City Council on Sept. 1 unanimously approved the new e-cigarette rules as
part of a law that regulates smoking lounges.

Costa Mesa staff has said the public park vaping ban updates the city's smoking
laws to protect residents from secondhand ""smokeless"" vapor.

As of April, 131 California cities and counties have passed laws to limit the
use of e-cigarettes, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency.

Anaheim, Garden Grove, Seal Beach, Mission Viejo, Laguna Hills and Laguna Niguel
have approved vaping regulations in recent years.

""The aerosol in electronic cigarettes contains chemicals that have been known to
be carcinogenic,"" Amy Buch of the OC Health Care Agency said Tuesday, citing
California Department of Public Health documents. ""This is an area of concern of
public health, not only for smokers, but for those who aren't smoking.""

Costa Mesa's ordinance also creates zoning regulations for smoking lounges
almost two years after the City Council approved a moratorium on hookah and
vaping parlors. The council approved and later extended the ordinance to address
concerns of neighbors, who said certain smoking lounges were open too late,
caused excessive noise, emitted odd smells and attracted drunken patrons.

The city's new rules would allow smoking lounges to open in some commercial
shopping centers - such as The Triangle, Harbor Center and Costa Mesa Courtyards
- and also in industrial properties.

The ordinance would prohibit the lounges from opening within 1,500 feet of each
other.

Councilwoman Katrina Foley asked city staff to add a provision that the lounges
also could not operate within 1,000 feet of schools.

The Costa Mesa ordinance will need to be read and approved a second time before
it officially becomes law.

Maine must decide whether to ban 'vaping' in public places

BYLINE: Mario Moretto BDN Staff

LENGTH: 695 words","


AUGUSTA, Maine -- While the electronic cigarette industry continues to boom,
Maine lawmakers must decide whether to include the products in the state's
no-smoking law for restaurants, bars, parks and other public areas.


While numbers for Maine are unavailable, the e-cigarette industry has burst open
in recent years and is expected to reach $3.5 billion this year, according to
CNBC. Electronic cigarettes are battery-operated devices that use a small
heating element to vaporize liquid nicotine, which is inhaled by the user.


The process often is called vaping, and critics say that, while it may not be as
dangerous as smoking regular cigarettes, the effects of the vapor still can be
harmful to the user and those exposed secondhand. However, because vaping
doesn't produce smoke, using the devices is legal in places where smoking is
prohibited.


Rep. Jeff McCabe of Skowhegan, the Democratic leader in the House of
Representatives, has introduced a bill, LD 1108, to ban vaping in all the same
places from which cigarettes are barred. He cites several prominent studies that
have revealed that some nicotine vapor contains known carcinogens, such as
formaldehyde.


""Parents should not have to worry about their children being exposed to harmful
vapor when they take them out to dinner or to the movies,"" McCabe said during a
public hearing on the bill Monday.


McCabe said his bill would clear up confusion among business owners and park and
beach operators about whether vaporizers should be allowed or not.


While e-cigarettes have been on the market for several years, the FDA still has
no regulations in place.


Public health advocates, including the American Cancer Society and American Lung
Association and Maine Public Health Associates, testified in favor of McCabe's
bill, saying that, while study of e-cigarettes is ongoing, the state should play
it safe.


""The burden should be on [e-cigarette manufacturers] to prove they're safe, not
on us to prove they're unsafe,"" Ed Miller of the American Lung Association,
said.


A report by the World Health Organization in 2014 found that electronic
cigarette vapor is not simply ""water"" -- as claimed by many manufacturers -- but
contains some toxins. However, the group reported the devices likely posed a
smaller health risk than conventional tobacco products, though it said it is
unclear exactly how much smaller the risk is.


The WHO also reported e-cigarettes still pose serious threats to teens and
fetuses.


In many ways, the only accepted fact about e-cigarettes is that there's still a
lot that's unknown about their health risks, as well as their purported role in
helping smokers quit.


Dan Riley, a representative of Reynold's American Inc, the second-largest
tobacco company in the country and producer of the Vuse electronic cigarette,
told the Health and Human Services Committee on Monday that the state should
recognize the products' as a ""tobacco harm reduction"" tool.


He cited the work of several doctors who asked the World Health Organization to
consider electronic cigarettes' place on a continuum of tobacco products, where
they believe it should be rated as far less dangerous than conventional
cigarettes, cigars, chew or snuff.


""These doctors were asking the WHO to consider this new science of tobacco harm
reduction and making sure they took into consideration that if these products
help smokers, cigarette smokers, stop smoking, that has the potential benefit of
saving many, many lives,"" he said.


However, Hilary Schneider of the American Cancer Society said the problem is
that not all e-cigarettes are created equal.


""We have often sought lab tests of AG's offices that have tested these products,
and not all of them contain the same things,"" she said. ""One e-cigarette is not
another, is not another. Some may not contain carcinogens, but many that we're
testing do contain harmful products.""


Because a bystander -- or even the user him or herself -- may not know what's in
the e-cigarette, the state should err on the side of caution, she said.


The Health and Human Services Committee will hold a work session and a vote on
McCabe's bill in the coming weeks.

cigarette vapor is not simply ""water"" -- as claimed by many manufacturers -- but
contains some toxins. However, the group reported the devices likely posed a
smaller health risk than conventional tobacco products, though it said it is
unclear exactly how much smaller the risk is.


The WHO also reported e-cigarettes still pose serious threats to teens and
fetuses.


In many ways, the only accepted fact about e-cigarettes is that there's still a
lot that's unknown about their health risks, as well as their purported role in
helping smokers quit.


Dan Riley, a representative of Reynold's American Inc, the second-largest
tobacco company in the country and producer of the Vuse electronic cigarette,
told the Health and Human Services Committee on Monday that the state should
recognize the products' as a ""tobacco harm reduction"" tool.


He cited the work of several doctors who asked the World Health Organization to
consider electronic cigarettes' place on a continuum of tobacco products, where
they believe it should be rated as far less dangerous than conventional
cigarettes, cigars, chew or snuff.


""These doctors were asking the WHO to consider this new science of tobacco harm
reduction and making sure they took into consideration that if these products
help smokers, cigarette smokers, stop smoking, that has the potential benefit of
saving many, many lives,"" he said.


However, Hilary Schneider of the American Cancer Society said the problem is
that not all e-cigarettes are created equal.


""We have often sought lab tests of AG's offices that have tested these products,
and not all of them contain the same things,"" she said. ""One e-cigarette is not
another, is not another. Some may not contain carcinogens, but many that we're
testing do contain harmful products.""


Because a bystander -- or even the user him or herself -- may not know what's in
the e-cigarette, the state should err on the side of caution, she said.


The Health and Human Services Committee will hold a work session and a vote on
McCabe's bill in the coming weeks.

OPINION: I'm a vaper, not a smoker

BYLINE: Martial Haprov, Daily Press, Victorville, Calif.

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 699 words","


Feb. 17--On Dec. 2, 2013, I smoked my last cigarette -- after nearly 10 years of
tobacco use. Minutes after I had extinguished said cigarette, I became an
ex-smoker and current vaper.

Vaper?

Now, instead of opening a pack of cigarettes, lighting up and inhaling the
burning tobacco smoke to quench a craving for nicotine, I use an electronic
device that delivers nicotine in water vapor form. It may look like tobacco
smoke when I exhale, but it's not.

Many call the device I use an electronic cigarette, or ""e-cig."" Those of us in
the vaping community detest that term; it's not a cigarette. Yes, the cheapest
versions of the devices sometimes look like cigarettes, and yes, what I exhale
while vaping looks like cigarette smoke.

But it's not smoke. It's not a cigarette. There is no tobacco.

When people refer to what vapers do as ""smoking,"" or refer to us as ""smokers,""
or say what comes out of our devices and mouths is ""smoke,"" it's not only
incorrect, it's frustrating.

The ""e-juice"" poured into the device -- which we prefer to call a personal
vaping device, PVD or simply ""vape"" -- is typically made up of four liquids:
propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, nicotine (many vapers go with no nicotine)
and flavoring (some vapers use no flavor).

Yes, nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes and is the one certain
common denominator between smoking and vaping. But the health effects, according
to studies published over the last few years, seem to be minimal at best.

No health problems

Igor Burstyn, a professor at Drexel University School of Public Health,
published one last August based on a review of available data. Burstyn's study
confirmed that chemicals generally found in e-juice pose no health concerns.

He also found that those who are in the vicinity of ""second-hand vape"" are
virtually unharmed, except in the cases of those whose lungs are sensitive to
water vapor.

Essentially, vapor from a PVD isn't much different than the clouds a fog machine
pumps out on a theater stage or at a nightclub, Burstyn noted.

Tobacco cigarette smoke, on the other hand, contains an estimated 7,000 chemical
compounds, 250 of which are poisonous and 70 of which are carcinogenic. Beyond
nicotine, the additives -- which near 600 in total -- include tar, ammonia,
acetone, formaldehyde, lead cadmium (found in battery acid) and arsenic,
according to the U.S. Department of Public Health.

Government agencies all over the country are considering adding vaping devices
to tobacco bans; some already have.

Where there's smoke?

On Jan. 28, the Orange County Register reported that the Orange Unified School
District would amend a policy that prohibits tobacco use in schools to ""include
electronic smoking devices.""

""There is a public-health concern,"" Gunn Marie Hansen, the district's assistant
superintendent of education services, said in the Register's report. ""We already
prohibit tobacco or nicotine use. Now we are including smokeless tobacco.""

It seems as often as once a week there's a story about more bureaucracy aimed at
including vaping devices in tobacco bans.

Whether one believes vaping should be allowed on school campuses, inside
government buildings, airports or airliners, a ban on them shouldn't be lumped
together with tobacco. Because it's not tobacco.

I understand the argument for not allowing vapes on school campuses. Ultimately,
the nicotine in e-juice is still as addictive as it is in cigarettes and other
tobacco products, and if something goes awry with your vape setup, the cigarette
cravings often return quickly. And a vaper's first goal is to never go back to
cigarettes.

More than two months after my last one, I don't miss it at all. Except for that
one time, I haven't had any cravings. Yes, I still get a nicotine fix, but I
also enjoy the flavors that I regularly rotate in my vape setup. They taste 100
times better than cigarettes and have no proven carcinogens.

I don't smoke anymore. I vape.

Garden City-based Lotus Vaping Technologies goes out-of-state for bank financing

BYLINE: Brad Iverson-Long

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 580  words","


Lotus Vaping Technologies is a growing distributor and seller of e-cigarette
equipment and ""e-juice,"" but the Garden City company had to go out of state to
get a line of credit at a bank.

After looking unsuccessfully in Idaho, Lotus recently got a $1.5 million line of
credit with Sterling Commercial Credit in Michigan.

Lotus CEO Bob Henry said the line of credit will help the company increase its
inventory, which will help it continue to grow and handle larger distribution
accounts.

Lotus ships products to all 50 states and Canada. The company sells e-juice, the
electronic cigarette liquid that typically contains nicotine, water and
flavoring, as well as the refillable tanks for e-juice, batteries and other
electronic cigarette parts. The company has 42 employees at its Garden City
warehouse and another 20 at its four  retail stores called Vape in the Treasure
Valley.

In December, the company started selling the Vape Case, a smartphone case that
includes a battery and vaping device.

""You can actually vape right off of your phone,"" Henry said. He said Lotus has
patented the case, which could be used as a primary or backup vaping tool.

""People never forget their phones,"" he said.

Lotus started as a different company, Lotus Electronic Cigarettes, which made
disposable electronic cigarettes. Henry said that company was sold to investors
after a leading disposable e-cigarette company, Blu, was sold to large tobacco
company Lorillard.

""It allowed them to dominate that market and became much more difficult for us,""
Henry said. He said the e-juice and refillable tank market doesn't have a
frontrunner, so it's a better area for new companies.

""Nobody had yet filled that void in this market. It made it pretty easy because
the whole industry was moving in this direction,"" he said.

Lotus Vaping Technologies formed last June. Henry said it was difficult to find
a local bank that would give the company a line of credit.

""The newness of the company and the newness of the industry provides an
obstacle,"" Henry said.

Henry turned to Scott Fischer, president and founder of the financial consulting
service CFO Idaho, to find a credit source. Fischer said it's not uncommon for
companies like Lotus, which have strong growth but not a long credit history, to
have difficulty finding a suitable bank.

""You have to find a financial institution that matches the profile of the
company that you're trying to fund,"" Fischer said. He said there aren't that
many lenders in Boise that are a match for companies like Lotus. In addition to
Sterling in Michigan, Fischer often works with lenders in Portland and Salt Lake
City. Fischer said that Boise's relatively small size could be a reason why
there aren't lenders for companies like Lotus. Often, wealthy individuals fund
banks that are willing to lend to new companies.

""Maybe we don't have anybody here with that kind of net worth who wants to get
in the financing business,"" he said.

Henry said Lotus's plan is to continue increasing its distribution and sales to
make Lotus a long-lasting company. While Henry wouldn't say if the bank would
look for more investors or new banking relationships, Fischer said that soon
Lotus could fit the lending profiles for more Idaho banks.

""We think that they'll be bankable, back in the Treasure Valley in the next year
or 18 months,"" Fischer said.

Letters to the editor: Make our roads safer for cyclists

SECTION: LETTERS

LENGTH: 1026 words","


I regularly cycle through Ludgate Circus and had flashbacks for months after
seeing an incident that could so easily have ended up like the collision last
Friday that fatally injured German postgraduate Janina Gehlau. I knew young tech
entrepreneur Venera Minakhmetova, who died at Bow roundabout last year; I went
on her memorial ride even before I discovered that it was she who had been the
victim.

I find the attitude of both transport planners and the cycling lobby
infuriating. We need changes now, not in two years' time when the east-west and
north-south superhighways are due to be completed.

We need deep ""bike boxes"" at all traffic lights, with cameras adjusted to
enforce them. We need islands at junctions, to force trucks to make wider left
turns. We need no-through roads for cars. We need to accept that jumping red
lights and riding on the pavement is often the only safe way to cycle, and grant
legal exemptions accordingly.

This can all be done immediately. It could have saved Janina. It doesn't even
cost much. Cyclists can't wait years for proper bike lanes to be built
everywhere. How many more graves will we need while we dither?Andrew Lockley

Many cyclists do ride crazily fast in London, as Janina Gehlau's mother observes
- that's the riding style you have to adopt with limited, often crazy cycle
infrastructure. It's so much more relaxed in Germany but you get to your
destination quicker as junctions and cycleways are better designed.

On average, Germans make about eight times more journeys by bicycle than we do
in the UK. Claims that London can't be a cycling city because it has too old a
road network are feeble - look at historic parts of Berlin and Hamburg that have
taken serious steps to support cycling, or at Amsterdam, famous for its narrow
streets yet Europe's number-one cycling city.

The UK remains deep in a dark cave of car dependency. We managed to clean our
cities up in the 1800s by constructing sewer systems; the same kind of effort is
needed now to change our transport system. It will be worth it because there are
so many health, social, economic and environmental benefits for everyone.Katja
Leyendecker, Newcastle

Cycle safety must be an integral part of road safety generally. Moving away from
calling collisions ""accidents"" is one step. Increased police traffic enforcement
should be a priority, with the hit-and-run menace tackled. Tougher enforcement
against foreign registered vehicles is another step.

To me, as a life-long cyclist and an Institute of Advanced Motorists certificate
holder with no points ever, driver behaviour is key. The LBC caller who called
this newspaper the ""Lycra Times"" needs to research who is responsible for road
deaths. I know of no country that charges cyclists to use the road; references
to ""road tax"" from some motorists are, frankly, pathetic.Peter Salter, SE16

TfL's vaping ban is unfair

TfL is by no means unusual in bringing in a ban on vaping, nor in its ridiculous
arguments in support of its policy, for example to mitigate fire risk (October
22).

Coffee chains and hospitals have banned vaping, despite there being no  evidence
that inhaling water vapour through ""passive vaping"" is a health risk, out of
apparent dislike of anything associated with smoking.

As a smoker for 35-plus years, I believe vaping is the most powerful tool in the
quitter's arsenal so far. By providing a smoking simulation that you can switch
off after a couple of drags, it offers not just a crutch but a framework with
which to break the habit. Surely ""normalising"" vaping is something we should
encourage?James Gray

Smoking has been banned for years on public transport so why would anyone think
it should be different for vaping? The smell is inoffensive but it still emits a
vapour that can enter others' personal space. I'd rather there wasn't a rule and
that people took it on themselves not to cause discomfort or annoyance to
others.S Bath

If Read is racist, politics is too

As a black former parliamentary candidate, I am appalled by the chorus of claims
that former BBC DJ Mike Read's UKIP Calypso is racist.If using a mock Caribbean
accent is racist, then the British Comedy Awards organisers who gave Sacha Baron
Cohen an Outstanding Achievement Award in 2012 must be racists too.

And if expressing opposition to immigration is racist, the main parties are
ultra-racists. The Home Office under this Government commissioned a van advert
screaming ""Immigrants go home"". In 2008, Labour introduced an anti-ethnic
minority immigration policy severely restricting entry visas for non-EU
citizens, making it very difficult for students and professionals from Africa,
Asia and the Caribbean to come here, or even for relatives to visit family
members.

The fact is, all the main parties are speaking in a mock Ukip accent. Voters
will easily differentiate between the real thing - seeking an end to EU
membership, the only way to tackle the immigration question - from the
imitators, cadging a blank cheque in return for a promise to deal with EU and
immigration issues after the election.Sam Akaki, W3

It's us Lib-Dems who want MP recall

It is untrue to say that I in any way ""watered down"" proposals to give voters
the power to recall their MP (leading article, October 21).

The bill debated on Tuesday fulfils what was in the 2010 manifestos of all three
main parties: a mechanism that gives voters the ability to force a by-election
if their MP commits serious wrongdoing. This is what was in the Coalition
Agreement and in the draft bill we published in 2011. Rather than a ""watering
down"", there was a disagreement with Zac Goldsmith over the best system. His
""rich man's recall"" would give immediate influence to vested interests and big
money that doesn't like an individual MP's stance on controversial issues.

In coalition, it is the Lib-Dems who have consistently argued for a recall
mechanism while the Conservatives have dragged their feet. It is right that we
now debate the best way to define ""serious wrongdoing"", and it is Lib-Dem MPs
who will be bringing forward amendments to ensure that MPs don't sit as judge
and jury on themselves.Nick Clegg MP, Deputy Prime Minister

Austin takes step toward e-cigarette ban

BYLINE: John Weiss, Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 552 words","


March 03--AUSTIN -- The Austin City Council on Monday took another step toward
banning e-cigarettes in any place where smoking is banned.

The matter came up in a work session two weeks ago; a year ago the city declared
a moratorium on them for a year so it could take a closer look. The regulation
also applies to hookahs and other devices for smoking.

The vote was much the same with Jeff Austin, Michael Jordal and Judy Enright
saying the ban would be an intrusion on people's rights but Steve King, Janet
Anderson and Jeremy Carolan voting for it. Because it was a tie, Mayor Tom
Stiehm cast the deciding vote and it was approved.

However, it's still not part of the city's code because only an ordinance that
passes unanimously can be approved on the first vote. The final one will be
March 16 when council member Dave Hagen is expected to be at the meeting; he has
indicated his support for the measure. The second vote only needs a majority.

Before they voted, Bonnie Rietz, a member of the Austin Drug Task Force, spoke
up in favor of the regulations. She said she's worried about the amount of
nicotine and other drugs in the vapor. The right of people to smoke e-cigarettes
""should not be more important that kids with asthma who are seated a couple
seats away"" in a restaurant. Or the rights of a pregnant woman or elderly person
with heart problems not having to inhale the vapor, he said.

Karissa Studier, a nurse with Mower County Health and Human Services, said
research in the past year has shown even more harmful effects from smoking
e-cigarettes, which is called vaping. The chemicals smoked have flavors such as
bubble gum that appeal to children. And there is no evidence the e-cigarettes
slow or stop the desire to smoke tobacco, she said.

Thor Bergland, who works for Austin Public Schools, added that ""vaping has
become a pretty big deal in our schools."" Some students have found a way to get
high using it and one student's parents found their son was having mood swings
that were traced back to vaping.

Anderson said ""it really is a public safety issue"" and that is why she was going
to vote for it.

But Enright said the ordinance won't help stop youths from vaping because it's
already illegal for them to now. Adding the ordinance will just make it more
attractive, she said.

Jordal said he wouldn't go to any place that allowed vaping, but he opposes the
ordinance because he doesn't want to take that rig ht away from someone who
wants to allow it.

The council also:

--  Unanimously approved having Friends of the Jay C. Hormel Nature Center buy
10 more acres of land on the north side of the park where the center is located.
That will probably be the last land the friends will buy there. The land will be
given to the city for the park.

--  Learned that a project to upgrade Riverside Arena will cost about $1.665
million. The city currently has $1 million from the city's building fund,
$250,000 from the Hormel Foundation and $150,000 from a Mighty Ducks grant. It
will replace the arena's ice-making and improve energy efficiency so the arena
will save $30,000 or more in a year from energy costs, said City Engineer Steven
Lang.

Bids are expected to be opened Thursday.

Costa Mesa moves to ban vaping

BYLINE: Jordan Graham staff writer, The Orange County Register

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B

LENGTH: 307 words","

DATELINE: COSTA MESA


It soon will be illegal to smoke an electronic cigarette in Costa Mesa parks.

The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the new e-cigarette rules as
part of a law that regulates smoking lounges.

Costa Mesa city staff have said the public park vaping ban updates the city's
smoking laws to protect residents from secondhand ""smokeless"" vapor.

As of April, 131 other California cities and counties have passed laws to limit
the use of e-cigarettes, according to the OC Health Care Agency.

Anaheim, Garden Grove, Seal Beach, Mission Viejo, Laguna Hills and Laguna Niguel
all have approved vaping regulations in recent years.

""The aerosol in electronic cigarettes contains chemicals that have been known to
be carcinogenic,"" Amy Buch of the OC Health Care Agency said Tuesday, citing
California Department of Public Health documents. ""This is an area of concern of
public health, not only for smokers, but for those who aren't smoking.""

Costa Mesa's new ordinance also creates zoning regulations for smoking lounges
almost two years after the City Council approved a moratorium on hookah and
vaping parlors. The council approved and later extended the ordinance to address
concerns of neighbors, who said certain smoking lounges were open too late,
caused excessive noise, emitted odd smells and attracted drunken patrons.

The city's new rules would allow smoking lounges to open in some commercial
shopping centers - such as The Triangle, Harbor Center and Costa Mesa Courtyards
- and also in industrial properties.

The ordinance would prohibit the lounges from opening within 1,500 feet of each
other.

Councilwoman Katrina Foley asked city staff to add a provision that the lounges
also could not operate within 1,000 feet of schools.

The Costa Mesa ordinance will need to be read and approved a second time before
it officially becomes city law.

SUNDAY ISSUE the E-cigs in the dock over safety of dodgy devices

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 594 words","


VAPING has been credited with helping millions of smokers kick their deadly
cigarette habit.

But experts have called for the e-cig craze to be tightened up after a spate of
cases of dodgy devices bursting into flames.

Leading academics also admit it could be years before they know what the lasting
effects of the vapourising products are.

A change in the law - due in May - will see them subjected to more stringent
checks.

Here CHRISTINE LAVELLE examines the debate surrounding the controversial
gadgets.

PUBLIC health chief Linda Bauld has warned smokers to beware of phoney
e-cigarettes - months before new laws aim to stamp out dodgy devices.

From May, vaping products face stringent health and safety checks under EU laws
which will also curb the way they are advertised.

It follows a string of incidents which left users with gruesome injuries caused
by dodgy products and chargers exploding.

We told days ago how Marc McParland's fingers were engulfed in flames, below,
after an e-cig blew up in his hands.

The barman, 21, was taken to hospital in agony and faces being scarred for life.

Professor Bauld, below, deputy director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol
Studies, said the public must only buy vaping devices from reputable vendors.

She said: ""There are very few product standards so there are definitely some
devices out there which were not well-made. ""They have lithium batteries so if
you use the wrong charger you're going to get in real trouble - in the same way
you would with a mobile phone.

""In May the European Tobacco Products Directive will mean the devices will have
to be registered as medicines going through an approval process.

n nero ""Or they can continue to be sold as consumer products subject to a
product notification scheme. That means the products will be given warning
labels, the liquids will need childproof caps, they'll -ts---l have to give
disclosed product contents and they'll also have to provide a safety certificate
for the battery and charger.

""But we may still see some of the devices being bought off the back of a white
van that don't meet this standard.""

The Stirling University professor added: ""I suggest people interested in these
e-cigarettes should go to a reputable vendor. ""There are some specialist shops
and you're more likely to get good advice from them and a better quality
product.""

Many experts have hailed vaping devices as a safer alternative to smoking and
believe they could save countless lives.

The gadgets heat nicotine-containing liquid into a vapour inhaled by the user,
giving them the smoking ""hit"" but with fewer hazardous chemicals than tobacco.

Professor Bauld said concerns remain over the possible lasting effects of vaping
products - which could soon be available on the NHS - but admitted the benefits
outweigh the risks.

And Emma Lloyd, from the Royal Society for Public Health, insisted nicotine on
its own is no more harmful than caffeine and believes smokers should be
encouraged to use vaping products. A recent report showed they are 95 per cent
safer than cigarettes, in which a smoker breaths in 4,000 chemicals.

Ms Lloyd said: ""Some studies found carcinogens and toxins in e-cigarette vapour
but these are at a much lower level than tobacco.""

And Professor Bauld added: ""At the moment we have two devices approved in the UK
as medicines.

""The only twist is they are made by British American Tobacco.""

Kate Toan: City's new vaping ban a mistake

BYLINE: Kate Toan

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 656 words","


Reading the public agenda announcement for the Feb. 3 city council meeting, I
saw the announcement of a proposed ""expanded smoking ban"" and thought to myself
""OK, sure. Cigarettes are bad, secondhand smoke is dangerous."" I decided to
spend my evening otherwise engaged. Imagine my surprise to open up my favorite
Boulder blog the next morning (Your Boulder) and find that the city had in fact
extended not just the geographic reach of our downtown  smoking ban, but also
expanded the definition of ""smoking"" to include vaporizers.The increasing
opacity of the political process around numerous project approvals and policy
changes is unacceptable. Agendas are not being honestly or fairly described, and
the public is not being sufficiently informed of these proposed decisions ahead
of time. Do I have an opinion about vaporizers? So happy you are interested --
yes. They save lives.

I am a former smoker who quit with the help of these devices, which simulate the
act of smoking itself in addition to delivering an optional dose of nicotine. I
was never strongly ""addicted"" to nicotine, but enjoyed the physical act of
smoking; therefore no other method (patch, gum, whatever) could satisfy the urge
to smoke the way vaping did. It feels good to be smoke-free, to smell nice and
have clean teeth and nails. To be able to live the active Boulder lifestyle!
Cigarettes are also deadly -- they harm every organ in the human body and kill
nearly 500,000 people a year  in the U.S. alone. That's one in five  deaths from
any cause! Cigarette smoke contains 5,000 chemicals, hundreds of which are
toxic. Nicotine, which can be lethal at high concentrations, is actually one of
the less harmful substances in cigarette smoke.

 In 2010, nearly half of all the smokers in the U.S. attempted to quit, but only
6 percent succeeded according to a CDC study (who knows how many re-started
after the study!). Quitting smoking has been said to be more difficult than
quitting drinking or using heroin. It might be almost as difficult as applying
for a building permit in Boulder!

 It is true that we probably do not have all the evidence surrounding potential
harms from the use of vaporizing devices. Much alarm has been raised over their
use however, and no wonder -- they threaten both the finances of the traditional
tobacco industry and alarm anti-smoking advocates who see immediate and total
abstinence as the goal. Studies consistently show that vaping, while not
completely benign, is far less harmful than smoking. Instead of hundreds of
toxins, which act in concert to produce disease, there are at most two in vaping
-- nicotine and the artificial ""smoke,"" which is the same kind used at rock
concerts and Halloween parties.

 Restrictions on smoking in public places were enacted in order to clean up the
problem with secondhand smoke and provide social shame and isolation that would
provide incentives to smokers to quit. However, after decades of efforts to
reduce smoking, there are still millions of smokers who are currently unable to
quit, despite knowing the health risks and despite penalties for smoking inside,
outside, in cars, hotel rooms, or basically anywhere except huddled over a trash
fire in the back alley.

 Our ""all or nothing"" insistence is killing people. The city council is wrong to
treat vaping as the health equivalent of smoking. How many smokers would switch
to vaping if it meant they didn't have to go outside the bar and around the
corner in February? How many lives would be saved by that many fewer cigarettes
being smoked? How many people might then find the strength to say goodbye to the
real thing, as I did? There is little to no evidence that secondhand smoke is a
concern, and we've allowed ""smoke machines"" at musical events since forever.
False equivalency and moral panic should not be allowed to stop something with
the potential to save so many lives.

KILLIAN QUIT CIGS TO FIRE UP VAPING PLANT

A FORMER smoker has turned his habit into a growing business.

Killian McGrath, 40, was puffing 40 a day until he quit three years ago.

But his struggle to go cold turkey led him directly into developing a factory in
Waterford making artisan vaping products.

Unlike the chemicals in cigarettes and regular e-cigarettes, the contents of
McGrath's 'e-juices', and the safety test results, are available online.

With studies showing e-cigs are a safer alternative to smoking, Killian thinks
vaping could help thousands.

He said: ""Smokers have been pariahs ever since the smoking ban. I was smoking
two packs a day and probably killing myself, now I vape guilt-free.""

A recent report from the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies found
e-cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than cigarettes.

However, Killian warned vapers should be vigilant about what products they use.
The industry is not yet regulated - though the EU is set to change that next
year - and already his company Wicked has reached the standard required.

He said: ""Know what you vape. The test results of every batch of Wicked eJuice
can be viewed online. We stand over our pure e-juice.""

Keen to copy the flavour he was used to in cigarettes, Killian began mixing
e-juice for his own use and soon found he had a nose for it. He said: ""There are
only five ingredients in Wicked eJuice - vegetable glycerine, monopropylene
glycol, flavour concentrates, nicotine and deionised water. We test them at
every stage - everything is safe.""

Vaping is growing so fast people are looking for flavours beyond tobacco - he
even has a range named after Breaking Bad character Heisenberg.

He said: ""Vaping is becoming divorced from smoking - it is not the same thing at
all. As a result I have developed new and exciting products, including my
flagship Heisen Blue range.""

E-cigarettes - the next public space menace?

SECTION: Pg. 13

LENGTH: 478 words","


After my recent column about smoking in public places, a reader wrote saying he
thought the new electronic cigarettes looked set to become the next smoking
menace.

He said he and his family were dining in a Joburg restaurant when they were
bothered by an unpleasant smell from the next table, where somebody was ""vaping""
away at his e-cigarette.

(Or, as my correspondent described it: ""the idiot kept sucking his electronic
lollipop"".) When challenged, the man said electronic cigarettes had been shown
to be 95 percent healthier than tobacco and there was no law against using them
in restaurants.

Fortunately, before an argument could start, the man's sons, who were with him
at the table, asked him to stop as he was embarrassing them. He did stop and put
away his electric lollipop. When he left, the writer thanked him for not vaping
and he smiled graciously and said ""no problem"", so all ended well.

I think the managers of public spaces will have to draw up clear rules about
vaping in public, just as they have had to control public smoking.

Luckily I have not encountered any bad vaping behaviour, so the problem has not
bothered me, but it obviously has bothered others.

We really have become addicted to our electronic attachments. I have seen people
walking along with electronic sounds being pumped into their heads via earphones
and electronic vapour being sucked into their lungs. Electric overload, I'd say.

Just because something is healthy doesn't mean it's suitable in public. I am
told that gargling with salt water is an excellent way to keep the throat
healthy, but I don't think it would be acceptable at a restaurant table, even
though the ingredients and equipment are all provided and I haven't seen any
notices banning it.

Medical Matters

I was amused to read that doctors and nurses in some American hospitals were
being urged to attend English lessons so their reports could be more accurate
and easy to understand. Some examples of interesting grammar and strange
statements on patients' reports were quoted.

""Yesterday his knee seemed better and today it had completely disappeared.""

""She has no temperature today but her husband said she was very hot in bed last
night.""

""The patient refused an autopsy.""

""The patient is tearful and crying constantly. She also appears to be
depressed.""

""The patient has no past history of suicides.""

""The patient said she had severe chest pains if she lay on her left side for
over a year.""

""Discharge status: Alive but without permission.""

And my favourite: ""The patient was in his usual good state of health until his
airplane crashed.""

Last Laugh

Harry came back from the doctor's consulting room looking very depressed.

""What's the matter?"" his wife asked.

""The doctor gave me some pills and said I would have to take one every day for
the rest of my life.""

""So, why is that such bad news?""

""He only gave me seven pills.""

Mankato latest to ban e-cigs indoors

BYLINE: JENNA ROSS; STAFF WRITER, STAR TRIBUNE (Mpls.-St. Paul)

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4B

LENGTH: 208 words","


Mankato has become the latest Minnesota city to restrict e-cigarettes - banning
their use in public, indoor spaces where smoking is not allowed. The City
Council passed the ban Monday with the hope that it might encourage statewide
action on the issue.

Council members said they want to protect people from the battery-powered
devices' secondhand vapor, tinged with nicotine, and keep ""vaping,"" the
e-cigarette equivalent to lighting up, from being an accepted activity for young
people.

""We don't want this to be the next cool thing in the nicotine addiction
program,"" said Mark Frost, a council member and pharmacist, by phone Tuesday.

Council Member Jason Mattick, who uses e-cigarettes, was the lone ""no"" vote. He
pitched vaping as a healthier alternative to smoking and had previously urged
the council to wait on taking action until the Food and Drug Administration
weighed in on vaping's safety. But that guidance did not quickly come.

Mankato drafted the ordinance restricting e-cigarettes after the City Council
voted in August to ban e-cigarette sampling in tobacco shops. Other cities have
restricted their sampling, sales and use on public property.

Duluth passed its own ban on e-cigarette vaping in indoor, public spaces in
September.

Quebec wants to ban 'vaping' for minors; Popular among Teens; Health minister
fears e-cigarette trend could lead to increase in youths smoking

BYLINE: MICHELLE LALONDE, The Gazette

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 797 words","


Outraged by the growing popularity of electronic cigarettes among Quebec
children and teens, Quebec's Minister of Public Health is considering outlawing
the sale of electronic cigarettes to minors and a ban on ""vaping"" in places
where smoking is also banned. A study released this week by the Canadian Cancer
Society, Quebec Division suggests that fully one-third of high school students,
and close to one in 10 Grade 6 students in Quebec have tried electronic
cigarettes.

""We have reduced smoking among young people a lot,"" Public Health Minister Lucie
Charlebois said in an interview with The Gazette.

""We don't want to see it come back. My preoccupation is public health of the
whole population and particularly young people. So I am very, very, very
concerned about electronic cigarettes.""

Charlebois said she is worried about adults setting an example for young people
by vaping in public places. She urged bar and restaurant owners to voluntarily
make rules against vaping inside their premises, since the Liberal government is
likely to ban the practise soon anywhere that smoking is currently banned.

""Anyway, if we legislate, they (bar and restaurant owners) will have to do
something, so maybe it is better to do something now,"" she said.

Electronic cigarettes, or ecigarettes, contain a batteryoperated microprocessor
that heats a liquid solution into a vapour (hence the term ""vaping"") that can be
inhaled and exhaled by the user, simulating traditional smoking. A light at the
end of the e-cigarette even simulates a burning cigarette tip. The liquid
solution is mostly propylene glycol, but also alcohol, water, flavouring - and
it sometimes contains nicotine and other substances.

Sales and advertising of e-cigarette products that contain nicotine or make
health claims (that they help with smoking cessation, for example) are illegal
in Canada.

But electronic cigarettes that claim to be nicotine-free are sold widely in
dépanneurs, gas stations and dollar stores across Quebec. They are also
available for purchase on the Internet.

But a study published last fall by the Canadian Cancer Society, Quebec Division,
showed that some electronic cigarette brands that are labelled as
""nicotine-free"" actually do contain the addictive substance. That study found
that five of nine brands labelled ""nicotine-free"" actually contained significant
quantities of nicotine.

""Manufacturers and distributors claim that these new products contain no
nicotine and that they only produce a harmless vapour, but we see clearly that
it's not true,"" said Mélanie Champagne, a director with the Canadian Cancer
Society, when that study was released. ""Nobody knows the exact composition of
these products ... many parents tell us that their children are trying out these
products for fun, to imitate adults.""

Public health officials are concerned that e-cigarette manufacturers, which are
increasingly the big tobacco companies, appeal to youth intentionally by
offering such kid-friendly flavours as Happy Berry, Raspberry Explosion and
Banana Cream Pie.

The Canadian Cancer Society study, released Wednesday, showed electronic
cigarettes are indeed making their way into the hands (and mouths) of youth. The
data collected in 2012-2013 showed 34.3 per cent of Quebec high school students
had tried electronic cigarettes.

Many of those students were already smokers of traditional cigarettes. But 18
per cent reported they have never smoked traditional cigarettes, but had tried
vaping.

Charlebois, an ex-smoker who quit nine years ago, said she is anxious to see the
results of studies by Quebec's Public Health department and Health Canada on how
effective electronic cigarettes are in helping smokers quit.

""We need the results of these studies before positioning ourselves, but what is
worrying us is these habits that are forming among young people. Nicotine
creates a dependence and as an ex-smoker I can say it is not easy to get rid
of.""

""When I see the Canadian Cancer Society announcing that 5,000 Grade 6 kids in
Quebec (have used electronic cigarettes), it is worrisome. For me, it is not
just that they have tried it. It is that I don't want it to be so attractive to
them that they develop a dependence and start to smoke for real.""

Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins is also considering action on the issue. On
Wednesday, he called on Health Canada to determine whether the products are
effective in aiding with smoking cessation, and said he will raise concerns
about youth vaping at a meeting of federal, provincial and territorial health
ministers next month in Banff, Alta. Toronto's medical officer of health
recently urged the city of Toronto to ban vaping in public places if the
provincial government doesn't take action on the issue by February. mlalonde@

Why public health advocates care more about heroin addicts than smokers

LENGTH: 1504 words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Enterprise Institute has issued the following news
release:



 Heroin is back. Its use has doubled over the last decade and overdose deaths
almost quadrupled between 2002 and 2013, according to the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC).



 The response has been robust. The White House held a summit on opioid abuse and
Congress has convened a number of hearingsand produced some bills.Health
professionals are calling for more aggressive use of opiate replacement
medications such as buprenorphine and methadone and for wider availability of
Narcan, a drug that instantly reverses overdose effects. Even conservative
states like Kentucky and Indiana now have needle exchange programs to help curb
the spread of Hepatitis C, HIV, and other infections.





 We applaud these efforts to reduce the harm from heroin use. But as an opiate
addiction expert (Satel) and a tobacco researcher (Rodu), we are baffled that
equivalent amounts of energy and political will are not directed at an even more
harmful addiction and public health scourge: smoking.



 The CDC collects data on both behaviors. According to the most recent
government statistics, HIV and viral hepatitis killed 15,000 Americans (not all
deaths were from IV drug use) in 2013 and 16,000 were linked to heroin and/or
opioid overdoses. By contrast, smoking caused 130,000 deaths in 2013 from lung
cancer alone and contributed to 450,000 deaths from all diseases.



 The CDC supports harm reduction for opiates. Its multi-point plan for dealing
with the &ldquo;heroin epidemic,&rdquo; as the agency calls it, includes, not
surprisingly, opiate substitution medications and sterile injection equipment.
But the CDC warns smokers to stay away from e-cigarettes or smokeless tobacco.
This flies in the face of the much-replicated data we have about the safety of
these products relative to cigarettes.



 Let&rsquo;s first take e-cigarettes and other vaping devices. They work by
heating a solution containing nicotine, propylene glycol and flavorings.
Critically, vaping does not combust tobacco; it produces no smoke and thus no
carcinogenic tars and gases. This means that the risks of cancer, lung disease,
and heart disease are vastly diminished compared to smoking.



 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regards propylene glycol as generally
safe; it is used in toothpaste, asthma inhalers, nicotine inhalers and many
other foods and cosmetics.



 Instead of encouraging smokers to switch to e-cigarettes, the CDC and other
tobacco prohibitionists have misrepresented them as a prominent source of
poisoning and a gateway to smoking in children. They have falsely portrayed
minuscule levels of contaminants in e-cigarette fluids and vapor as dangerous,
and they have ignored growing evidence that smokers are switching.



 Indeed, scare-mongering has become a talking point of major health
organizations. Here is the American Lung Association: &ldquo;[We are] concerned
about the potential health consequences of electronic cigarettes.&rdquo;
Globally, the World Health Organization, which promotes needle exchange, has
called e-cigarettes a &ldquo;threat.&rdquo; The California Department of Health
launched a campaign this spring, Still Blowing Smoke, touting the utterly
debunked claim that vapers routinely expose themselves to high levels of
formaldehyde. Meanwhile, the Department reasonably endorses needle exchange.



 The miasma of misinformation swirling around vaping affects public perception.
A Reuters poll completed on June 4 found that just 35 percent of Americans
understand that &ldquo;e-smoking is healthier than traditional
cigarettes.&rdquo; The rest, nearly two-thirds, either disagree with that
statement or don&rsquo;t know.



 Compare the alarmism surrounding vaping with the evidence-driven and pragmatic
approach of the CDC&rsquo;s British counterpart Public Health England (PHE), an
executive agency of the UK Department of Health. Two weeks ago, PHE became the
first national government agency to endorse e-cigarettes as safer options for
smokers and encouraged switching from cigarettes to vaping products. In its
report, E-Cigarettes: An Evidence Update, the agency strongly rejected claims
that vaping is a pathway to smoking, that nicotine poisoning is a risk, and that
formaldehyde is present at biologically meaningful levels. The PHE is so
enthusiastic about e-cigarettes that it suggested the National Health Service
should prescribe them as smoking cessation devices.



 PHE is concerned that &ldquo;perceptions of the relative harmfulness of
e-cigarettes have become less accurate&rdquo; since 2013. With good reason:
Misrepresenting the facts about e-cigarettes and instilling doubt about their
relative safety is a dangerous game. It keeps smokers inhaling deadly toxins.
After all, why give up familiar, deadly cigarettes if vaping is just as bad?



 Let&rsquo;s now turn to smokeless tobacco. Like e-cigarettes, it provides
nicotine but no smoke. In addition, because smokeless tobacco has been around
for many decades, a large body of scientific evidence documents that it is 98%
safer than smoking. It does not cause lung cancer, heart disease or emphysema.
Like any natural product, American and Swedish smokeless tobaccos have low
levels of contaminants such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines, TSNAs (8-15 and 2
parts per million respectively). Though these relatively low levels have never
been shown to be meaningful with respect to cancer risks, everyone wants to keep
consumption of these agents at a minimum. Swedish and American products do just
that. The picture is different in Asia, India, and Africa: the TSNA levels in
smokeless products there are much higher and so are mouth and throat cancer
risks.



 The Swedish experience is highly instructive. For fifty years Swedish men have
preferred tobacco in a smokeless form called snus (a tiny tea bag filled with
spit-less tobacco that&rsquo;s held between the upper lip and gum. The result:
the lowest rates of smoking, lung cancer &ndash; indeed, of all smoking-related
deaths &ndash; in the developed world. In fact, if all men in the European Union
smoked at Swedish rates, over a quarter million deaths would be avoided every
year. And snus is not a &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; to smoking among Swedish youth.



 Yet, in this country, the American Cancer Society has consistently misinformed
the public about snus (see here, here, here, here, here). And the CDC&rsquo;s
webpage lists a litany of dangers including cancer, heart disease and stroke
that virtually guarantees no smoker would switch to smokeless. The actual risks
are small or non-existent and make smokeless far safer than smoking.



 Researchers have now accumulated a mountain of data on the value of needle
exchange and methadone. The same can be said of long-term use of nicotine and
smoke-free tobacco. So why does the heroin surge merit a rational response from
public health officials while they oppose harm reduction for smokers?



 There are many answers. For one, the timing: the uptick in heroin is relatively
recent, whereas smoking has been around forever and rates have been slowly
declining. Drugs often involve young adults, and the overdose problem is
dramatic and gets attention; smokers, on the other hand, are older, get chronic
illnesses and die slowly. Drug use is linked to crime and social problems that
affect other people, not just the user. Smoking primarily harms only the smoker.




 In terms of harm reduction, deploying strategies for opiate users is a
well-established approach. In the late 1800s and early 1990s, doctors maintained
patients on laudanum and opium, and in the early 1920s some major cities had
morphine maintenance clinics. In the late 1960s and early 1970s methadone
clinics came on the landscape. Needle exchanges sprouted in the 1980s and 1990s
to combat the transmission of HIV.



 Unfounded fears are the major source of prohibitionist policies toward vaping.
E-cigarette opponents claim that they are protecting children from a vaping
&ldquo;gateway&rdquo; to smoking and, ultimately, its
&ldquo;renormalization.&rdquo; Evidence to date suggests that these fears are
unrealized and that vaping is instead a gateway to nonsmoking. Epidemiologists
will continue to monitor the vaping-smoking dynamic to see if the current
pattern of more teen vaping, less teen smoking holds, as well as the health
effects, if any, of long term inhalation of propylene glycol.



 Smoking and heroin abuse are two deadly habits. There is ample room within the
portfolios of the CDC, the California Department of Health, the WHO and other
respected health agencies to make life safer for both smokers and drug users.
Their failure to champion tobacco harm reduction the way they have opiate harm
reduction is a glaring violation of public trust.



 Brad Rodu is a professor of medicine and holds an endowed chair in tobacco harm
reduction research at the University of Louisville.

equivalent amounts of energy and political will are not directed at an even more
harmful addiction and public health scourge: smoking.



 The CDC collects data on both behaviors. According to the most recent
government statistics, HIV and viral hepatitis killed 15,000 Americans (not all
deaths were from IV drug use) in 2013 and 16,000 were linked to heroin and/or
opioid overdoses. By contrast, smoking caused 130,000 deaths in 2013 from lung
cancer alone and contributed to 450,000 deaths from all diseases.



 The CDC supports harm reduction for opiates. Its multi-point plan for dealing
with the &ldquo;heroin epidemic,&rdquo; as the agency calls it, includes, not
surprisingly, opiate substitution medications and sterile injection equipment.
But the CDC warns smokers to stay away from e-cigarettes or smokeless tobacco.
This flies in the face of the much-replicated data we have about the safety of
these products relative to cigarettes.



 Let&rsquo;s first take e-cigarettes and other vaping devices. They work by
heating a solution containing nicotine, propylene glycol and flavorings.
Critically, vaping does not combust tobacco; it produces no smoke and thus no
carcinogenic tars and gases. This means that the risks of cancer, lung disease,
and heart disease are vastly diminished compared to smoking.



 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regards propylene glycol as generally
safe; it is used in toothpaste, asthma inhalers, nicotine inhalers and many
other foods and cosmetics.



 Instead of encouraging smokers to switch to e-cigarettes, the CDC and other
tobacco prohibitionists have misrepresented them as a prominent source of
poisoning and a gateway to smoking in children. They have falsely portrayed
minuscule levels of contaminants in e-cigarette fluids and vapor as dangerous,
and they have ignored growing evidence that smokers are switching.



 Indeed, scare-mongering has become a talking point of major health
organizations. Here is the American Lung Association: &ldquo;[We are] concerned
about the potential health consequences of electronic cigarettes.&rdquo;
Globally, the World Health Organization, which promotes needle exchange, has
called e-cigarettes a &ldquo;threat.&rdquo; The California Department of Health
launched a campaign this spring, Still Blowing Smoke, touting the utterly
debunked claim that vapers routinely expose themselves to high levels of
formaldehyde. Meanwhile, the Department reasonably endorses needle exchange.



 The miasma of misinformation swirling around vaping affects public perception.
A Reuters poll completed on June 4 found that just 35 percent of Americans
understand that &ldquo;e-smoking is healthier than traditional
cigarettes.&rdquo; The rest, nearly two-thirds, either disagree with that
statement or don&rsquo;t know.



 Compare the alarmism surrounding vaping with the evidence-driven and pragmatic
approach of the CDC&rsquo;s British counterpart Public Health England (PHE), an
executive agency of the UK Department of Health. Two weeks ago, PHE became the
first national government agency to endorse e-cigarettes as safer options for
smokers and encouraged switching from cigarettes to vaping products. In its
report, E-Cigarettes: An Evidence Update, the agency strongly rejected claims
that vaping is a pathway to smoking, that nicotine poisoning is a risk, and that
formaldehyde is present at biologically meaningful levels. The PHE is so
enthusiastic about e-cigarettes that it suggested the National Health Service
should prescribe them as smoking cessation devices.



 PHE is concerned that &ldquo;perceptions of the relative harmfulness of
e-cigarettes have become less accurate&rdquo; since 2013. With good reason:
Misrepresenting the facts about e-cigarettes and instilling doubt about their
relative safety is a dangerous game. It keeps smokers inhaling deadly toxins.
After all, why give up familiar, deadly cigarettes if vaping is just as bad?



 Let&rsquo;s now turn to smokeless tobacco. Like e-cigarettes, it provides
nicotine but no smoke. In addition, because smokeless tobacco has been around
for many decades, a large body of scientific evidence documents that it is 98%
safer than smoking. It does not cause lung cancer, heart disease or emphysema.
Like any natural product, American and Swedish smokeless tobaccos have low
levels of contaminants such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines, TSNAs (8-15 and 2
parts per million respectively). Though these relatively low levels have never
been shown to be meaningful with respect to cancer risks, everyone wants to keep
consumption of these agents at a minimum. Swedish and American products do just
that. The picture is different in Asia, India, and Africa: the TSNA levels in
smokeless products there are much higher and so are mouth and throat cancer
risks.



 The Swedish experience is highly instructive. For fifty years Swedish men have
preferred tobacco in a smokeless form called snus (a tiny tea bag filled with
spit-less tobacco that&rsquo;s held between the upper lip and gum. The result:
the lowest rates of smoking, lung cancer &ndash; indeed, of all smoking-related
deaths &ndash; in the developed world. In fact, if all men in the European Union
smoked at Swedish rates, over a quarter million deaths would be avoided every
year. And snus is not a &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; to smoking among Swedish youth.



 Yet, in this country, the American Cancer Society has consistently misinformed
the public about snus (see here, here, here, here, here). And the CDC&rsquo;s
webpage lists a litany of dangers including cancer, heart disease and stroke
that virtually guarantees no smoker would switch to smokeless. The actual risks
are small or non-existent and make smokeless far safer than smoking.



 Researchers have now accumulated a mountain of data on the value of needle
exchange and methadone. The same can be said of long-term use of nicotine and
smoke-free tobacco. So why does the heroin surge merit a rational response from
public health officials while they oppose harm reduction for smokers?



 There are many answers. For one, the timing: the uptick in heroin is relatively
recent, whereas smoking has been around forever and rates have been slowly
declining. Drugs often involve young adults, and the overdose problem is
dramatic and gets attention; smokers, on the other hand, are older, get chronic
illnesses and die slowly. Drug use is linked to crime and social problems that
affect other people, not just the user. Smoking primarily harms only the smoker.




 In terms of harm reduction, deploying strategies for opiate users is a
well-established approach. In the late 1800s and early 1990s, doctors maintained
patients on laudanum and opium, and in the early 1920s some major cities had
morphine maintenance clinics. In the late 1960s and early 1970s methadone
clinics came on the landscape. Needle exchanges sprouted in the 1980s and 1990s
to combat the transmission of HIV.



 Unfounded fears are the major source of prohibitionist policies toward vaping.
E-cigarette opponents claim that they are protecting children from a vaping
&ldquo;gateway&rdquo; to smoking and, ultimately, its
&ldquo;renormalization.&rdquo; Evidence to date suggests that these fears are
unrealized and that vaping is instead a gateway to nonsmoking. Epidemiologists
will continue to monitor the vaping-smoking dynamic to see if the current
pattern of more teen vaping, less teen smoking holds, as well as the health
effects, if any, of long term inhalation of propylene glycol.



 Smoking and heroin abuse are two deadly habits. There is ample room within the
portfolios of the CDC, the California Department of Health, the WHO and other
respected health agencies to make life safer for both smokers and drug users.
Their failure to champion tobacco harm reduction the way they have opiate harm
reduction is a glaring violation of public trust.



 Brad Rodu is a professor of medicine and holds an endowed chair in tobacco harm
reduction research at the University of Louisville.

Why craze no longer seen as breath of fresh air;
Vaping was initially seen as a healthier alternative to smoking tobacco, but
changes in the law seek to restrict the trend. Siobhan Fenton reports

BYLINE: Siobhan Fenton

From May 20, how you vape will change. Last year saw e-cigs hit the mainstream
as people everywhere took up vaping in droves. It's believed that a staggering
2.6 million adults in the UK currently use e-cigs and the figure is rising.

Yet, as their popularity increases, so too have calls for greater regulation.

New rules from the EU which come into force from May 20 are set to make some big
changes to how you vape. From this date, the 2001 Tobacco Products Directive
will be updated so that e-cigarettes will be classified as a tobacco related
product.

A report published last month revealed that vaping could be no better than
smoking regular cigarettes and could be linked to cancer, according to
scientists. The study, which showed that vapour from e-cigarettes can damage or
kill human cells, was published last December prior to the devices being rolled
out by UK public health officials as an aid to quit smoking this year.

Researchers found that cells which had come into contact with vapour were more
likely to become damaged or die than those which had not.

The paper, which was published in the Oral Oncology journal, concluded that the
tests ""strongly suggest"" that electronic cigarettes are ""not as safe as their
marketing makes them appear to the public"".

New rules will include: 1 Smaller refill containers There are currently no
limitations on the size of refill containers, however a new maximum size of 10ml
will be enforced. This means users will no longer be able to bulk buy to save
money, which will result in a possible overall price increase.

2 Potency will be weakened Currently, the maximum strength permitted is 24mg,
this will drop to 20mg.

3 Smaller tanks and cartridges Cartridges will be reduced to 2ml.

4 Child proof Due to the sudden popularity of vaping, there have been concerns
that they could become popular with school children as smoking begins to appear
""cool"" again. Under new EU regulation, all e-cigs and related packaging must be
""child proof "".

5 Much greater government scrutiny Manufacturers in the industry will be asked
to submit to the government open, detailed and transparent information about
what the products they sell do and also what exactly they contain.

6 Opens up the possibility of banning e-cigs altogether If at least three EU
member states express a desire to ban e-cigarettes, it will be possible to
initiate processes towards banning them.

Why the European Union is no friend of innovation;
THE CITY VIEW

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 399 words","


The EU is set on treating vaping the same way it treats cigarettes HE STORY of
the e-cigarette ought to feature as a case study in every economics class and
every business studies textbook on every campus in the land. It's a story
containing all the forces that shape market economics and enterprising
endeavours. The e-cig first emerged in response to changing social and
regulatory conditions, as tobacco smoking became more expensive and less
acceptable.

That's the first chapter of the case study story: identifying and filling a gap
in the market. Chapter two could look at the role of innovation and
technological progress, as devices improved at a rate of knots. There could also
be chapters on competition, as consumers can choose from a wide array of brands
and products, as well as entrepreneurship - given that there are now 8,000
vaping shops on Britain's high streets and a plurality of small manufacturers.
So far, so good. Unfortunately, any such case study would also have to contain a
chapter on regulatory overkill. In May this year, revisions to the EU's Tobacco
Products Directive will come into force. Despite not containing any tobacco,
e-cigs have been lumped into the Directive because the Public Health division of
the European Commission's Health and Food Safety Directorate claim that the
long-term health effects of such devices are not yet known. The Directive is
dressed up in the language of the free market, claiming that it will ""improve
the functioning of the internal market for tobacco"" but could in fact destroy a
growing industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs in the UK. The majority
of popular vaping devices are manufactured by smaller firms who will now have to
endure the bureaucratic hardship of reporting annually to the government on ""the
sales volumes of the products, types of users and their preferences and trends"".
Most damaging of all is the ban on advertising and promotion of vaping products.
The EU is determined to treat an anti-tobacco product the same way it treats
cigarettes. Why? After all, this is a product that, according to Public Health
England, is 95 per cent safer than tobacco. It's innovative, it's
entrepreneurial and it's a free-market solution to the problems associated with
traditional tobacco consumption. Just what does the EU have against it?

Washington: Compliance checks resuming to curb tobacco sales to minors

LENGTH: 380  words","

DATELINE: Clark County


Clark County, Washington has issued the following news release:

To address a sharp rise in the illegal sale of tobacco and vaping products to
Clark County youth, Clark County Public Health is reinstating tobacco compliance
checks to discourage local retailers from selling tobacco and vaping products to
anyone younger than 18.

The sale of tobacco and vaping products to minors in Clark County more than
doubled between 2010 and 2014. The steady increase followed a 2010 loss of state
tobacco prevention funding that meant the discontinuation of compliance checks
by Public Health. Using alternate state funding, the department will reinstate
compliance checks on June 30.

""Our primary goal is education. We want retailers to understand the law so we
can help prevent youth access to these unhealthy and highly addictive products,""
said Cyndie Meyer, Chronic Disease Prevention program manager. ""Most tobacco
users pick up the habit as teens, so it's important to discourage tobacco and
e-cigarette use in youth.""

Public Health has been alerting local retailers about the resumption of
compliance checks since mid-June. During a check, trained, underage youth
volunteers go to a retailer where they attempt to purchase a tobacco or vaping
product. If the sale is successful, accompanying Public Health staff explains
the law to the clerk and reports the transaction to the state Liquor Control
Board.

Penalties for clerks are $50 for the first offense and $100 for each subsequent
offense. Penalties for the retailer range from $100 to $1,500 and include
six-month, one-year and five-year license suspensions for third, fourth and
fifth offenses, respectively.

""Most illegal sales of tobacco and vaping products occur because clerks either
don't ask for identification or they incorrectly calculate the teen's age after
looking at the identification,"" said Long Vue, Public Health health educator.
""Our goal is to educate, not to trick or penalize people. We just want sales to
youth to stop.""

Among Clark County 10th graders who responded to the 2014 Washington State
Healthy Youth Survey, 11 percent reported smoking cigarettes within the past 30
days and 22 percent used e-cigarettes.

Vaping poison put children at risk

BYLINE: Jonathan Leake

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 294 words","


ECIGARETTES have caused 241 poisoning alerts after people accidentally gave
themselves potentially huge overdoses of pure nicotine, an NHS report has
warned.

A quarter of the victims were children under five who played with the refill
capsules. Others were adults who mistook the nicotine capsules for eyedrop
containers while several cases involved capsules releasing concentrated liquid
nicotine when they should only have emitted a vapour.

""The liquid in ecigarettes and their refills contains toxic doses of nicotine
and even small volumes can cause serious harm to a small child. Urgent
consideration needs to be given to safe storage and packaging,"" said a report
from the NHS's National Poisons Information Service (NPIS).

In its 2014-15 report, the NPIS said it had received 241 telephone calls
concerning ecigarettes and their refill solutions this year. ""This is more than
the 204 received during the previous year, which in turn was greater than the
total number of inquiries about these products received over the previous six
years.""

Ecigarettes work by heating a liquid containing nicotine and turning it into a
vapour the user inhales - often called vaping.

The nicotine is still toxic but the absence of the other combustion products
generated by the tobacco in traditional cigarettes makes vaping much safer than
smoking.

A recent study by Public Health England (PHE) showed that 2-3m adults now use
vaping products, almost all as a safer alternative to cigarettes.

A PHE spokesman said there was an emerging problem with the way such products
were packaged and a new EU directive would come into force next May, which would
require products to be child- and tamper-proof.

He added: ""When used as intended, ecigarettes pose no risk of nicotine
poisoning.""

Is a ban on vaping nanny state gone mad? A BAN on the use of ecigarettes;
UK'S FIRST E-CIG LAW IS SET FOR 2017

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 629 words","


A BAN on the use of ecigarettes in public spaces such as restaurants, bars and
workplaces is being pushed ahead in Wales.

A new law - the UK's first on e-cigs - comes into force in 2017, despite
disagreement over the dangers of ""vaping"".

Anti-smoking groups including ASH Wales, Cancer Research UK and Tenovus oppose a
ban, arguing that e-cigs are less harmful than traditional smoking.

Here, a senior doctor and a recent vaping convert give their views.

Dr Charlotte Jones NO Chair of General Practitioners Committee Wales 'Doctors
don't want the use of e-cigs to become normalised' WHILE e-cigarettes have a
potential role to play in helping current smokers to quit, we are concerned the
products themselves are not quality assured.

That means we don't know what harm they might do and whether one make of
e-cigarette might be more harmful than another.

There is also a risk of passive vaping in public places, which can be associated
with health risks.

Even though the constituents of the vaping products may be lower than in normal
cigarettes, it is still a risk, particularly if you have any underlying cardiac
or diabetic problems.

That is why the British Medical Association's annual representatives' meeting
supported the motion to ban e-cigarettes in public places.

There is also a risk that people using them in public places will encourage
those who are not currently smokers to start using these products because they
may be seen as an attractive or a cool thing to do.

That is something we would not want to encourage in any way because we don't
want people smoking at all.

We particularly don't want to see these products advertised to children, or to
current non-smokers, and we feel their use in public places could normalise the
activity.

Although the health risks from e-cigarettes would appear to be less than from
normal cigarettes, we just don't know for sure.

There is no real evidence on this matter.

Lisa Minot YES Sun Travel Editor, long-term smoker and new vaper 'It's vapour.
I'm hardly going to steam a poor waitress or cabbie to death' FOR me, it was the
Vape Escape.

For nearly 30 years I had been trapped by my total, utter, serious addiction to
cigarettes.

Then, just seven short days ago, an e-cigarette set me free.

I am and always will be a smoker. I love the smell, the nicotine high, the fact
it keeps my weight down and a million other reasons over the years why I
couldn't give up.

But with my husband keen to quit and my kids constantly on my case, it had
stopped being fun.

It had become no more than a dirty habit - and an expensive one at that.

So with my husband three weeks into his own e-cig experiment, I decided to give
it a go.

I went in with my eyes open. I know vapes are unproven. There may be hidden
medical issues.

But for me, this was a way of cracking a far more dangerous addiction and one I
know for a fact could kill me.

Just seven days in, vaping has helped me off the cigs - I hope for good.

For the first time in 30 years I am not lighting up cigarettes and drawing
cancerous tar and additives into my body.

I am gradually reducing the amount of nicotine my body craves and I hope I will
eventually be able to give up vaping.

After 30 years, I have found my way of giving up. But it won't be easy.

To stop committed smokers like me from using an e-cig in public places is
ridiculous. There is no harmful smoke, just water vapour. I'm hardly going to
steam a poor waitress or a cabbie to death.

For the first time in 30 years, this tool has made me feel that I could kick my
cigarette habit.

To stop me from using it is madness.

2.6million adult Brits using ecigarettes 1.1million of those users are former

Vaping banned in public spaces

BYLINE: Andrea Hill, Saskatoon Starphoenix

SECTION: CITY; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 351 words","


People can continue to vape in Saskatoon e-cigarette shops despite new
legislation that will ban the practice in all other public places where smoking
is prohibited.

It's a victory for Vapor Jedi owner Mitch Tarala, who told city councillors on
Monday that vapers' safety would be jeopardized if his staffwas banned from
using e-cigarettes in-store to show customers how to properly use them.

""Some of the devices don't work with each other properly if you don't know what
you're doing,"" he said.

""If you put the wrong battery in the wrong device, you could have problems.""

He said incidents of exploding ecigarettes could rise if e-cigarette shop
staffwere not able to demonstrate safe e-cigarette use to new customers.

The ban on vaping in public places except e-cigarette shops was passed by
council on Monday. As of Jan. 1, vaping will be prohibited in city-owned parks,
pools and playgrounds; city buildings; childcare facilities; schools; public
transit; casinos; restaurants; and private clubs.

Exempting e-cigarette shops from this ban runs contrary to a recommendation from
Jennifer Miller, vice-president of health promotion for the Lung Association of
Saskatchewan. She told councillors that secondhand vapour could be hazardous to
e-cigarette shop employees.

""Let's consider workplace safety and put public health first,"" she told
councillors.

Council voted 9-1 to exempt ecigarette shops from the vaping ban. Only Coun. Pat
Lorje voted against the exemption.

""I feel very sad that we're even having to have this conversation,"" said Lorje,
who described ecigarettes as ""the last gasp of the nicotine industry"" to deliver
their product to people.

""What we're now doing is saying, 'Well, because somebody who's smart enough to
figure out a different vehicle for delivering nicotine into people's body other
than a cigarette, pipe, snuffor cigar, well we're just going to sit back and do
nothing and say meh.'"" Council also voted to exempt ceremonial tobacco

Vapor advocates;
Business owners say product helps smokers quit

BYLINE: Sandy Meindersma, CORRESPONDENT

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. A,10,1

LENGTH: 660 words","


WORCESTER -- Like the nicotine patch before it, vaping advocates say it provides
a safer way to place nicotine into the bloodstream, and is fast becoming the way
for smokers to quit.

""It simulates smoking,"" said Si Caponette, co-owner of City Vapor and E-Cig in
Kelley Square.

""There is the inhaling, the hand to mouth, and it delivers nicotine to your
system. It's a much healthier lifestyle, and as you use it, you become less
dependent on the device.""

Mrs. Caponette, who purchased the City Vapor franchise with her husband, Mark,
and relocated to Worcester from southwest Florida, said she smoked for 35 years
and quit as a result of using e-cigarette products.

Mr. and Mrs. Caponette opened their store in August. Since then, Mrs. Caponette
said, she has many customers quit their two-pack-a-day cigarette habit as they
have converted to vaping.

According to Urban Dictionary, vaping refers to inhaling vapor from
e-cigarettes, which don't produce smoke.

""There was a 34-year-old girl who came in with two patches, and she didn't think
she could quit,"" Mrs. Caponette said.

""But she was in a few weeks ago and she can now walk up and down her stairs,
which she had never been able to do.""

""Nicotine doesn't cause cancer, and smokers are addicted to nicotine,"" she said.
""But when you light up a cigarette, you activate 4,000 carcinogens, 60 of which
are known cancer causing agents.""

But e-cigarettes are still controversial, because they still deliver nicotine,
the addictive substance in cigarettes.

""I support legislation to prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes to minors,"" said
state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, D-Acton, in an emailed statement, ""because I believe
that the product is used to target children and teenagers to get used to
cigarettes, and increases the likelihood that they will turn to tobacco
cigarettes as they get older.""

Electronic cigarettes are not regulated by the U.S. Food And Drug
Administration, which announced recently that it is taking steps to regulate
products meeting the legal definition of a ""tobacco product.""

That would put e-cigarettes -- as well as hookahs and some types of flavored
cigars -- into the same category as regular cigarettes, cigars and smokeless
tobacco products; those are subject to regulation under the federal Food, Drug
and Cosmetic Act.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta reported recently that
1.1 percent of middle school students and 2.8 percent of high school students
used e-cigarettes in 2012, which represented a doubling from 2011.

""The CDC says its findings indicate that more efforts are needed to monitor and
prevent all young people from taking up the use of both conventional and
non-conventional forms of tobacco,"" the CDC wrote in its Nov. 15 edition of the
""Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.""

Mrs. Caponette said she stocks only pharmaceutical-grade nicotine that is
organic and 100 percent natural. The nicotine is released at one of three
predetermined levels.

Vaping is also less expensive than cigarettes.

""To smoke two packs a day costs $20 a day,"" Mrs. Caponette said. ""Vaping costs
about $25 a month.""

To ease the transition from smoking to vaping, City Vapor stocks 38 flavors of
the e-liquid, which vaporizes when a battery-activated coil heats it.

""We try and match the person to their brand, and we customize the product to
them,"" Mrs. Caponette said.

""If you're a heavy smoker, then you're going to need a product with a
longer-lasting battery. Otherwise, if your battery dies, you're going to go out
and buy a pack of cigarettes.""

Despite touting e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to cigarettes, Mrs.
Caponette discourages nonsmokers from imbibing.

""The best thing to breathe is fresh air,"" she said.

""This is strictly an adult product -- no one under 18 is permitted to enter the
store.""

Mrs. Caponette said she expects vaping to grow significantly as an alternative
to both smoking and the nicotine patch.

""I've had two people walk out, saying, 'You've saved my life.' ""

Nutter signs law that bans 'vaping'

BYLINE: By Seth Zweifler; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: PHILADELPHIA; P-com News Politics; Pg. B05

LENGTH: 598 words","


As Mayor Nutter took out his pen Wednesday to sign two bills that crack down on
""vaping,"" or puffing on electronic cigarettes, Gregory Conley broke the silence
in the Mayor's Reception Room at City Hall.

""Congratulations on hurting public health and deceiving smokers into believing
that e-cigarettes are harmful,"" Conley shouted at the mayor while holding an
e-cigarette.

As a member of Nutter's security team stood in front of Conley, an e-cigarette
lobbyist, the mayor fired back: ""That device might be harmful, but he's
harmless.""

Then Nutter signed the bills that prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes to minors
and ban vaping in Philadelphia workplaces, bars, restaurants, and other public
spaces. The laws also apply to all other electronic smoking devices, such as
vape pens, e-hookahs, and e-cigars.

The first bill, which stops the sale of e-cigarette products to minors, took
effect immediately. The second, which bans the use of e-cigarette products just
about everywhere, including stores, movie theaters, museums, schools, common
areas of apartment buildings, and hotels, will take effect July 1.

""We don't know yet what effects e-cigarette vapor may have on their users or on
the people around them, but we do know that e-cigarette vapor has been found to
contain nicotine,"" said Nutter, the architect behind the city's smoking ban in
2007. ""We believe that erring on the side of caution is important for the
health, safety, and welfare of all of our citizens.""

Nutter on Wednesday called the bills, originally sponsored by City Councilman
William K. Greenlee, a ""sensible extension"" of the 2007 Clean Indoor Air Worker
Protection Law.

New Jersey in 2010 was the first major jurisdiction in the nation to ban the use
of e-cigarettes in most public places, joined later by the states of Utah and
North Dakota. Several major cities - Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and
San Francisco &ndash; have done so as well. At least 26 states, including New
Jersey, ban sales to minors; a bill is pending in Harrisburg.

E-cigarettes are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, although new
rules are expected soon. Supporters of local legislation say that the devices
potentially pose serious public-health concerns, especially to children and
teenagers.

Opponents argue that the vapor produced by e-cigs is harmless. Vaping, advocates
say, can help wean longtime smokers off cigarettes. A citywide ban on vaping in
public places, they say, is unenforceable.

Conley, a volunteer with the National Vapers Club, said he had smoked cigarettes
for eight years before he tried a watermelon-flavored e-cig.

""It helped me quit overnight,"" the 27-year-old said.

In the South Street neighborhood, where several vape shops have sprouted up over
the last year, e-cig enthusiasts were also disappointed with Wednesday's
legislation.

""It's a no-brainer that it shouldn't be sold to minors, but that doesn't mean
vaping should be treated like smoking,"" said Michael Chhem, co-owner of Love
Vape, 608 S. Fifth St.

Hours after Nutter gave his seal of approval to both bills, Chhem, 23, sat with
several friends and coworkers inside his store, puffing away on a
battery-powered, green-apple-flavored device as vapor filled the small, colorful
room.

For Conley, the e-cig debate in Philadelphia should come down to a matter of
choice.

""If 99 percent of all Philadelphia businesses decided to, on their own, ban
e-cigarette use, that's their right,"" Conley said. ""But what about the 1 percent
that wants to allow them? It doesn't make any sense.""

Are e-cigarettes a tool to kick habit or a hot trend?

SECTION: MAIN; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 937 words","


Remember when smoking ""looked cool""? Old films would often portray handsome
couples smoking cigarettes elegantly at a bar. Due to today's modern health
stats, tar-filled plumes of smoke may no longer be alluring, but the new ""vaping
"" trend is quickly taking its place despite the hazy situation concerning its
regulations and legality.

Vaping is the act of using an e-cigarette, which electronically vapourizes
liquid for inhalation, and is becoming a popular way for tobacco users to trash
their habit. However, it's becoming much more than a device for quitting. Vaping
has branched off into a diverse subculture of its own.

Out of nowhere, electronic cigarette stores are setting up shop, while vape
cafés are popping up all across Canada, where vapers can get the scoop on the
latest vaping devices and ""e-juice"" flavour cartridges. There are even people
who claim to be ""vapologists"" who can recommend which e-juice will arouse your
taste buds the most according to your personal preferences.

The device is usually a thin cylinder made of three parts: the USB-charged
battery, the atomizer which heats up the liquid and turns it into vapour, and
the liquid cartridge. Vapers simply hold down a button to vapourize the liquid
and inhale.

Two years ago, Jamie Burke and his wife were spending more than $500 a month on
cigarettes. Back then if you had told him he was going to dump his tobacco love
affair for an electronic wand, he would have called you mad.

Today, Burke stands at new business Vape City, an electronic cigarette and
accessories store. He pulls a device that looks like a walkie-talkie to his lips
and exhales a cloud of cotton candy vapour. The puff is basically odourless and
disappears within seconds.

""My mother and father smoked for years and were quite sick and I finally got
them on these things and both their lives just changed around. My father has a
chronic lung problem and he could barely cross the street and now he's walking
around the park,"" said Burke. ""I found the product amazing myself and that's how
I got here today.""

Burke says he'll get 100 customers on any given day.

The Mapleton Road building is small with a few shelves lining the walls and some
standing glass cabinets. The cabinets display all sorts of e-cigarette starter
kits - some look like plastic cigarettes while others are big and clunky like
Burke's. Others look like giant fountain pens or light and slick like a laser
pointer.

Rory Pollard, an employee at Vape City, prefers a stylized look. His e-cigarette
is pen-shaped with a golden spiral pattern twisting towards the mouth piece.

""My dad is addicted to the accessories. He's got one of every kind including a
little one that he's never even used, but he bought just in case,"" said Pollard.
""It's definitely become a style thing and everybody has different tastes.""

Up on the shelves of the shop are little bottles of e-juice. Vape City has more
than 100 flavours ranging from grandma's apple pie to watermelon wowzers.

""It's funny because it's usually the big burly men who come in here asking for
the fruity flavours, and it's the young women looking for the tobacco flavours,""
said Burke.

E-juice is the liquid vapourized when using an electronic cigarette. Some of
these liquids contain doses of nicotine while others don't have a trace of the
addictive substance.

""It's called vaping because you're vapourizing liquid and not actually burning
and smoking a bunch of chemicals,"" said Burke.

In 2009, Health Canada advised Canadians to not participate in vaping because
the safety of the products had not been proven. Burke says when he opened the
shop he received a letter from Health Canada stating he is not allowed to sell
any products with more than four doses of nicotine.

""We feel as though these vapour flavours may be attractive to youth. Electronic
cigarettes might serve as a gateway for youth to start smoking cigarettes,"" said
Dr. Denis Allard, deputy chief medical officer of health.

Even as vaping becomes more common, the legal status of the devices remains
unclear. Health regulators remain silent on how or if they plan on regulating
the booming industry.

Despite the lack of regulation, Burke refuses to sell to minors.

However, the Internet provides an online alternative for buying and selling the
futuristic inhalers. More commonly seen on the web are personal vapourizers
(PV). Vapers will strip down an e-cigarette and remodel them to accommodate a
wide array of specific vaping needs from long-lasting batteries to higher ranges
of voltage to create larger amounts of vapour.

For vapers, prices and styles can range from mass produced e-cigarettes which
can be purchased at local convenience stores to one-of-a-kind crafted PVs which
can sell for hundreds of dollars.

This expanding subculture and the countless quitting smoking success stories is
what drew Marc Sonier down the rabbit hole of vaping. For years, Sonier drove
cabs and during his long shifts he would smoke two packs a day.

Sonier came from a family of smokers and by 13 he had already invested in his
first pack. After an uncle was recently diagnosed with cancer, the Soniers
looked for ways to wean off their habit. Like many others, the Soniers found
e-cigarettes to be a god-send.

Now, Sonier is preparing to open Vape Vision Café, Moncton's first e-cigarette
lounge. Like Burke's Vape City, Sonier will have an assortment of e-juice
flavours along with coffee and baked goods.

""I'm hoping people will use this place as somewhere you can sit down and talk
about quitting smoking - kind of like a support group to help people with
different alternatives to quit smoking,"" said Sonier.

Ministry to set guidelines

BYLINE: Aliza Shah

LENGTH: 299 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: THE Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism (KPDNKK) Ministry
will soon come out with a standard guideline for the manufacturing of vaping
devices to safeguard public safety.

Its minister, Datuk Hamzah Zainuddin, said KPDNKK, together with the Health
Ministry, was conducting a study which, among others, would look at suitable
vaping devices.

""Together with my officers, I have met with non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), such as the Malaysian Organisation of Vape Entities to discuss the
matter and they have also agreed to have new regulation on vaping.

""KPDNKK will focus on the devices whereas the Health Ministry will be looking at
the content of the liquid in the device.

""Both ministries will then refer the matter to the Finance Ministry, which will
later decide on the tax structure,"" he said after chairing the National
Cooperative Consultative Council at Istana Hotel, here.

The study, he said, would, among others, look at standardising the types of
batteries and filters that could be brought in and manufactured in the country.

""We don't want people to bring in different devices (which have different safety
measures) without any control.

""It is not an easy task (to regulate). Some vaping devices use round batteries
while others may be using normal AA batteries. We are working together with
Sirim Bhd to fine-tune this matter,"" he said adding that he hoped the issue
would be solved as soon as possible to avoid it from being politicised.

KPDNKK secretary-general Datuk Seri Alias Ahmad said the study would also look
at the laws that could be used to govern the industry.

""Currently, we are using the Consumer Protection Act 1999 and the Trade
Descriptions Act 2011. However we may introduce a new law or add on another
clause to the current law,"" he said.

Will e-cigs be a smoking gun?;
DEBATE OVER INCREASE IN 'VAPING'

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 866 words","


EVER since e-cigarettes went on sale in 2007, Ireland has been huffing and
puffing about whether or not ""vaping"" is a good thing.

Some say they help quitters while others say they ""normalise"" smoking and
encourage kids to take up the habit. Either way sales are booming, with one in
four of adults in Ireland having actually tried them.

But their use is largely unregulated. Yesterday the Irish Sun told how gran Jean
Booth was left fighting for her life in a fire after allegedly trying to light
an e-cig. So should we steam on, or is it time for a rethink? Here EMILY
FAIRBAIRN and LYNSEY HOPE present the Great Irish Vape Off.

is vaping dangerous? E-CIGS work by vaporising liquid nicotine, and delivering a
hit to the lungs without the killer tar and toxins found in normal cigarette
smoke.

With almost 7,000 smoking-related deaths in Ireland every year, advocates argue
that e-cigarettes could save millions of lives by offering an alternative to
harmful tobacco.

But the jury is out on whether e-cigarettes are completely safe.

Until new legislation comes into force, there is no regulation of the substances
found in the ""vape"". The long-term health risks of these chemicals are unknown.

Meanwhile, some health experts say we should be trying to wean people off
addictive nicotine. Research shows 11 per cent of smokers use e-cigs alongside
their normal cigarette habit.

There are also fears that vaping both normalises and glamorises smoking -
arguments used by the Welsh government last month when proposing a ban on e-cig
use in public places.

And it's not just health concerns - fire chiefs are also worried that smokers
are unaware of risks.

What's in an e-cig? EACH device consists of a battery, a cartridge filled with
nicotine, a solution of propylene glycol or glycerine mixed with water, and an
atomiser to turn the solution into a vapour.

The exact contents of an e-cig varies from brand to brand, but there can be up
to 4,000 chemicals in each, some potentially cancercausing. These include
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and certain metals. French researcher
Thomas Laurenceau, who published a study on carcinogenic chemicals found in many
e-cig brands, said: ""Some e-cigarettes can deliver potentially toxic compounds
in vapours.

""Some e-cigarettes we tested deliver levels equivalent to or higher than some
cigarettes. It is clear smoking cigarettes with tobacco can cause cancer and
these e-cigarettes contain similar levels of some of the same poisons.""

E-cigs often come with additives and flavourings, such as chocolate, fruit,
coffee, menthol or tobacco.

Who is smoking them? RESEARCH shows e-cigarette use is almost entirely confined
to current or ex-smokers. It found over half of tobacco smokers have tried them,
and 11 per cent currently use them. Celebrity fans include Leonardo DiCaprio and
Helen Flanagan, both left. Cheryl Cole and Lily Allen also use them Snoop Dogg
is marketing his own vapouriser pen. An increasing number of teens are
experimenting with e-cigs, raising fears they could be using the devices as a
""gateway"" into nicotine addiction.

A US study of nearly 40,000 youngsters found e-cigarette use among school
students doubled to 6.5 per cent between 2011 and 2012. Teens who had tried an
e-cig were six times more likely to smoke traditional ciggies.

Teen vaper Ella Williams, 18, said: ""For now e-cigarettes are quite cool because
you can smoke them indoors, and there is no smell - so it's good to do with your
friends on a night out.""

WHILE cigarettes are subject to punishing tax and duty, with e-cigarettes only
VAT applies - meaning bumper profits for the manufacturers.

A single cigarette selling for about 48c has 38c tax and duty, leaving just 20
per cent for the maker.

The Irish Exchequer earned about #1.2billion from tobacco duties and tax last
year. Meanwhile e-cig sales here skyrocketed by 478 per cent last year -
generating some #7.3million in revenue. Receipts from e-cigarettes are minimal -
and traditional tobacco giants are rushing to join in.

Professor ROBERT WEST Professor of Health Psychology and Director of Tobacco
Studies at University College London FOR A RECENT expert panel judged
e-cigarettes to be at least 20 times safer than cigarettes. There can be no
doubt that if every smoker switched to them it would save tens of thousands of
lives every year.

Some argue they encourage kids to start smoking, but so far the evidence does
not bear this out.

Very few people use them who have never smoked. More smokers are stopping and
there is no sign of more young people starting to smoke.

Doctor RAM MOORTHY Spokesman for the British Medical Association AGAINST AS
doctors we are very concerned about e-cigarettes and specifically about their
safety. So we welcome any legislation making them subject to regulation.
However, this may not come into force until the near future and we think it
should happen much sooner than that. Another concern is that e-cigarettes are
normalising smoking behaviour, just when the smoking ban has started to succeed
in making smoking socially unacceptable.

We want to see legislation banning e-cig sales to under-18s brought in as soon
as possible and strongly enforced.

Should we thank you for vaping?

BYLINE: Joanna Heath

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6

It's not smoking, it's ""vaping"". And it's a term that could become a lot more
familiar in Australia than it is now.

In Europe and the United States, where it is legal in many jurisdictions to sell
them on supermarket shelves, the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes has
sparked pitched battles in the public health community.

E-cigarettes are battery-charged vaporisers, some designed to look like
traditional cigarettes, allowing users to inhale pure nicotine without the more
toxic byproducts of burning tobacco.

Some argue they are a safer alternative to smoking and should be embraced as a
quit aid with enormous public health benefits.

Others argue they are untested and a way for tobacco companies to ""re-normalise""
the idea of smoking.

And with manufacturers knocking on the door to increase their availability in
Australia, the local debate is starting to heat up.

Selling e-cigarettes in any form is illegal in most states, and there are legal
grey areas for those who possess them. But the internet has opened the way for a
few pioneers to test the waters.Tobacco lobby

Drew, a 35-year-old office worker in Canberra, started vaping two years ago when
he noticed smoking tobacco was affecting his fitness.

""I tried the lozenges but they were repulsive. They didn't give you enough
nicotine,"" he says.

""I thought I'd give e-cigarettes a go and I haven't had any problems with them
and so I haven't really done anything about stopping.""

Unlike cigarettes, there is nothing to stop users ""vaping"" indoors, making it
less anti-social. Drew says they are also far cheaper than tobacco cigarettes,
at about $3 a replacement cartridge.

Nicoventures, an e-cigarette company owned by British American Tobacco, has been
treading the corridors of federal Parliament in recent weeks making the case for
relaxing regulations. The company has had preliminary discussions with the
Therapeutic Goods Administration on submitting its product for approval.

Its Asia-Pacific director of regulatory and medical affairs, Stephen Jenkins,
argues e-cigarettes have the potential to save lives if used properly.

""The Australian government has an opportunity to lead the world alongside the UK
in tobacco harm reduction by adopting a more progressive approach to products
such as electronic cigarettes,"" he says.Health risks

But the Department of Health says it is concerned about the use of e-cigarettes
in Australia, because of a lack of proof on their safety and efficacy.

""The impact of wide-scale use of these devices on tobacco use generally is not
known, and the outcome in the community could be harmful,"" a spokeswoman says.

Australian research into e-cigarettes is in its early stages, with most studies
coming from the US and UK. Many have found little evidence of health concerns.
But a major report published by the World Health Organisation in August
recommended caution on long-term health effects, particularly for young people
and pregnant women.

In a comment piece for medical journal The Lancet, University of Queensland
academics Wayne Hall and Coral Gartner argued it was inconsistent for
e-cigarettes to be subject to a total sales ban in Australia when tobacco could
be legally sold.

But Paul Grogan, director of advocacy at Cancer Council Australia, says
Australia should be viewed as a special case. ""We have record low levels of
youth smoking. That's the real risk here, we've got a lot to lose that other
jurisdictions may not. That puts us in a different situation.""

Peabody moves to ban vaping at work and in public

BYLINE: John Castelluccio, The Salem News, Beverly, Mass.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 923 words","


Dec. 06--PEABODY -- It appears health officials in Peabody won't create an
exemption for retail e-cigarette shops after all in pending revisions to the
city's environmental smoke regulations.

The Board of Health was poised to adopt the new regulations, which would ban
vaping in the workplace or in public places, but postponed that vote on Oct. 30
in order to consider language to exclude specialty shops from the ban. That
decision came after arguments from Peabody shop owners and several customers who
said the main benefit the shops offer customers trying to quit smoking is to
demonstrate how to safely operate the electronic devices.

Chairman Bernard Horowitz said the consensus among board members after a meeting
last week was to leave the proposed regulations as is, to fairly address their
initial concerns about second-hand vapors and due to the fact the exemption
would only end up benefiting one shop.

""We all felt the same,"" he said. ""The reason why we didn't vote on it right away
(in October) was to digest everything."" Horowitz added that he wanted time to
consider all the testimony from that hearing and find out if other communities
allowed similar exclusions.

They don't. The board looked at several North Shore communities -- including
Salem, Beverly and Swampscott -- and they all had blanket vaping bans, he said.

In the meantime, a new shop on Lowell Street -- Perfect Hit Vapors -- received a
special permit from the City Council on Nov. 6 with numerous restrictions
attached, including banning vaping inside the shop.

Horowitz said Peabody Vapors on Main Street is also subject to an order from the
building department, prohibiting the shop from having a lounge, and the board
isn't willing to allow the Smoke to Live kiosk at the Northshore Mall to qualify
for such an exemption. That only leaves The Vapor Guild on Tracey Street.

Strong health concerns at vapors

Under state law, the city is required to have a medical doctor on the board and
that person's opinion ""holds weight"" with him, Horowitz said, referring to Dr.
Leigh Mansberger's strong health concerns over e-cigarettes and second-hand
vapors.

""Why would I really want to oppose a doctor who has more knowledge than me?""
Horowitz said.

Mansberger declined to comment for this story, but during the October hearing
likened e-cigarettes to ""toxic"" drugs as she talked about harmful effects of
nicotine and cases of overdosing and even death related to nicotine poisoning.

She and board member Stephen Kalivas cited a 2014 study by the American Heart
Association that says nonsmokers can be exposed to nicotine particulates and
potentially toxic organic chemicals from secondhand vapors, and they also shared
concerns at the complete lack of regulation on e-cigarettes and ingredients by
state or federal authorities.

Horowitz acknowledged he initially felt the proposed exemption was reasonable
and Kalivas had also indicated in October he could support the measure.

""We said we would discuss it and we did,"" said Kalivas this week, referencing
the same issues as Horowitz. ""It would be difficult for the police to enforce.""

He said the distinction between sampling products, which the board doesn't want,
and instruction of how to properly use an e-cigarette is a close one and that
would inevitably lead to legal complaints.

An about face?

The way Michael Greene, co-owner of The Vapor Guild, sees it the board is
reneging on a promise and taking a ""closed-minded"" stance on the issue.

""It's not right, don't renege on something you voted on in front of a bunch of
people,"" said Greene. ""That's not cool.""

He believed board members had agreed to postpone their vote in October so they
could consider language for an exemption with the intent of inserting it in the
regulations. ""And then all of a sudden they're changing their minds,"" he said.

Greene said he could understand if there was an outcry from the community about
e-cigarettes, but the only concerns he sees are the ones coming from health
officials.

""All our customers, they don't just sit here and vape, they learn things,"" he
said.

""It will definitely tear my profit in half. I can't even teach [customers] how
to use it and [they] go home and God forbid anything happens,"" Greene said.
""They're making it more dangerous by banning it.""

Horowitz said a simple solution then is to ""step outside."" The regulations only
prohibit vaping or smoking within 15 feet of a building entrance.

The Board of Health next meets Dec. 15 and will resume its review of the
proposed regulation changes. Horowitz expects the board will take a vote that
night. The meeting is 6:30 p.m. in the basement conference room at City Hall.

""I think we've heard as much as we need to hear,"" he said.

""We have no idea what's in these products... Nobody is accountable for what's in
there,"" said Horowitz. ""They could be vaping gasoline.""

In general, the vapor shops that have opened recently say they sell products
that use juices made of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and polyethylene
glycol -- with nicotine optional. A common chemical found in the expelled vapor,
however, is formaldehyde.

Horowitz said the major issue is that without regulations, someone could sit in
a restaurant and freely vape away in the thick of nonsmokers. ""I think that
would be highly offensive.""

Vaping 'gives you superbugs'

SECTION: NEWS:OTHER; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 217  words","


VAPING makes electronic cigarette users more vulnerable to superbugs, suggests
new research.

The study, published in the Journal of Molecular Medicine, claims e-cigarettes
directly kill airway cells and weaken the immune system.

Regular vaping also causes inflammation  while boosting bacterial virulence,
according to the research.

Campaigners estimate that 2.6million adults in Britain use e-cigarettes, often
to try and cut down on smoking. That figure is roughly equivalent to 17.6 per
cent of all smokers.

The study, using mice exposed to e-cigarette vapor, shows it is ""not benign"" and
can ""directly kill lung cells.""

Inflammatory markers in the mice, who inhaled the vapour for an hour a day, five
days a week for four weeks, were elevated 10 per cent compared to unexposed
mice.

Doctor Laura Crotty Alexander, staff physician at the Veterans Affairs San Diego
Healthcare System in the US, said: ""This study shows that e-cigarette vapour is
not benign - at high doses it can directly kill lung cells, which is
frightening.

""We already knew that inhaling heated chemicals, including the e-liquid
ingredients nicotine and propylene glycol, couldn't possibly be good for you.

""This work confirms that inhalation of e-cigarette vapor daily leads to changes
in the inflammatory milieu inside the airways.""

Old-school smoko goes 'vapo'

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 310 words","


THE old-fashioned smoko could soon be replaced by the more modern vapo, with
Oxford Dictionaries revealing ""vape"" is its international word of the year for
2014.

To vape is to inhale and exhale the vapour produced by an electronic cigarette.
As a noun it describes the actual device.

Computer robots that scour the web for Oxford Dictionaries show that use of the
word ""vape"" doubled in 2014 from 2013.

""That's a steady and sizeable growth,"" senior editor Fiona McPherson said.

""But it's nothing like 'selfie' - that was so ridiculously phenomenal.""

Selfie was the 2013 word of the year.

The term originated in Australia with a young, drunk man first using it in 2002
to describe a self-portrait photograph.

Interestingly, vaping the word existed well before vaping the phenomenon.

E-cigarettes were invented in China in 2003, however, the earliest known use of
the word vape is from a 1983 UK magazine.

In an article on smoking Rob Stepney described a hypothetical device as: ""an
inhaler or 'non-combustible' cigarette, looking much like the real thing, but
delivering a metered dose of nicotine vapour. [The new habit, if it catches on,
would be known as vaping.]""

Ms McPherson says the growth of the term vape in the past few years is down to
the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes.

""There was a real gap in the language,"" she said.

""If you're going to be pedantic about it, saying that you're smoking something
if it's not actually producing smoke doesn't seem quite right.

""So a word was needed to say exactly what it is people are doing,"" Ms McPherson
said.

The World Health Organisation in August warned e-cigarettes pose a ""serious
threat"" to foetuses and young people.

The body recommended banning e-cigarettes from public indoor spaces ""until
exhaled vapour is proven to be not harmful to bystanders"".

In Australia it's illegal to sell e-cigarettes with nicotine. AAP

E-cigarette use among teens is up sharply

BYLINE: BY GREG HARDESTY, CONTRIBUTING WRITER

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. E

LENGTH: 451 words","



HIGHLIGHT: Officials: Too many unknowns about vaping's health effects.


Hey, Miss Smarty-Pants Teen, that electronic cigarette you're smoking? Well, it
just may blow your face to smithereens.

No, seriously, I'm not being alarmist.

As parents, we often go overboard when cautioning our teens about bad stuff like
drugs and drinking, the importance of driving safely and avoiding, at all costs,
any romantic urges until at least the age of 40.

My teen daughter doesn't smoke e-cigarettes (um, right, Reina?), but, if she
did, I would point out, in the imaginary conversation above, the true-life story
of a man in Florida who was vaping when the device exploded in his mouth.

A faulty battery was blamed for that 2012 explosion, which essentially turned
his e-cigarette into a bottle rocket that blasted out his front teeth and took a
chunk out of his tongue. And we haven't even gotten to the potentially harmful
stuff that's inside e-cigarettes.

For the uninitiated, e-cigs are battery-operated devices that heat up a liquid
solution that contains nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals, such as the
organic compound propylene glycol, and glycerin, a sugar alcohol compound.

E-cigs do not contain dangerous tobacco tar - the stuff that kills - and other
chemicals found in traditional cigarettes. This fact supposedly makes e-cigs a
healthier alternative to smoking and a means, for many people, to try to quit
smoking.

But are e-cigs less harmful than traditional cigarettes? In short, the jury
still is out. Because vaping is relatively new, the long-term effects of
e-cigarettes on health still are unknown, experts say.

One thing is certain: Vaping among teenagers is exploding.

Use of e-cigarette devices among middle and high school students tripled from
2013 to 2014, bringing the share of high school students who use them to 13
percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control. That percentage exceeds
the number of high school students who puff on traditional cigarettes. So the
chances of catching your teen vaping are getting higher every day. What to tell
them if you do?

Dr. Maily Creamer, a physician at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport
Beach, specializes in internal medicine and pediatrics, as well as acupuncture
therapy.

""People think because e-cigarettes contain no tobacco that they are less
dangerous than cigarettes, but in reality, they contain nicotine, which is
addictive, as well as microparticles of chemicals that can end up deposited in
the lungs,"" Creamer said.

Creamer said there have been no studies about the long-term health effects of
e-cigs. ""Proponents of e-cigarettes like to point out that no studies have come
out saying they aren't safe, but that doesn't mean there is proof that they are
safe. There still are a lot of unknowns.""

More kids try e-cigs than fags

BYLINE: ANDREW GREGORY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 138 words","


MORE kids aged 11 to 15 tried vaping e-cigarettes than smoking last year,
official figures reveal.

Vaping was seen as a tool for smokers to get their nicotine fix without inhaling
harmful smoke but the long-term health impacts are still unclear.

The Faculty of Public Health have raised concerns that vaping might promote
nicotine addiction in young people and see more starting to smoke ""real""
cigarettes.

But a pupil survey by the NatCen Social Research and the National Foundation for
Educational Research shows 22 per cent vaped at least once in 2014 while only 18
per cent smoked.

NatCen director Elizabeth Fuller said: ""We can't be certain why this is so but
there are likely to be a number of reasons, including the novelty element, price
and the fact there are currently no restrictions on children under 18 buying
e-cigarettes.""

E-cigarette adverts 'encourage children to try vaping', say experts;
Research suggests children could start vaping - and flavoured e-cigarettes could
act as 'gateway' to tobacco

BYLINE: By James Rodger

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 357 words","


New research released this week suggests averts for e-cigarettes are encouraging
children to take up 'vaping'.

Flavoured e-cigarettes are increasingly popular in the UK, including Coventry
and Warwickshire, but it remains illegal to sell the devices to under-18s in the
country.

Despite this, it is understood 'vaping' is rising among teenagers, with health
officials concerned they could act as a gateway to smoking tobacco.

Researchers from Cambridge University have now discovered that adverts featuring
flavoured e-cigarettes, such as chocolate and mint, are more likely to attract
school children and youngsters to try the devices.

Funded by the Department of Health, the study involved almost 600 schoolchildren
split into three groups.

One group was shown adverts for flavoured e-cigarettes - which are marketed
across the globe in hundreds of different flavours - while the second group was
shown advertisements for non-flavoured cigarettes.

The third group was not shown any adverts.

Study author Dr Milica Vasiljevic, of the Cambridge Behaviour and Health
Research Unit, stated: ""We're cautiously optimistic from our results that
e-cigarette ads don't make tobacco smoking more attractive, but we're concerned
that ads for e-cigarettes with flavours that might appeal to school children
could encourage them to try the products.""

Children in group one confirmed they liked the adverts more, and even expressed
a greater interest in buying and using the e-cigarettes than group two.

Story Link Ban on smoking e-cigarettes at London Midland stations starts

Professor Kevin Fenton, director for health and wellbeing at Public Health
England, said: ""The UK already has some of the strongest regulations on
e-cigarette advertising, and these will be further tightened by new European
regulations being introduced in May.

""Responsible e-cigarette marketing needs to recruit adults away from smoking and
in the UK it has been effective in doing this.

""And there is no evidence that advertising has encouraged young people to take
up regular vaping.

'It's important we recognise that flavoured e-cigarettes can appeal to adults as
an alternative to smoking.""

Washington: Norton Gets Airplane Noise Control and Her Other Priorities in FAA
Reauthorization Bill

LENGTH: 907 words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: Office of the MP Eleanor Holmes Norton has issued the following
news release:



 Despite divisions on a controversial Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
reauthorization bill, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), a senior
member of the normally bipartisan House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee and one of the ""Big Four"" transportation leaders who wrote the
recently-enacted surface transportation bill, got her major priorities for the
District of Columbia and the nation into the bill, which passed the committee
last night.





 ""What D.C. residents will find most important in this FAA bill is what did not
make the headlines: our provisions to increase control of airplane noise and the
related issue of limiting the number of flights at Regan National Airport,
banning the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices on planes, continued
authorization of the Disadvantages Business Enterprise program to ensure equal
treatment in the awarding of contracts, and our ongoing work on reforming the
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority's auditing and contracting
regulations.""



 Statutory Mandate to Control Airplane Noise



 Norton got significant provisions to address outrageous airplane noise that has
been plaguing communities in the District and nationwide as a result of new Next
Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) flight paths.  Norton's provision
requires the FAA to conduct a review of aircraft noise exposure and its effects
on communities around airports, including a review of FAA's community
involvement practices for NextGen projects located in metroplexes.  Until now,
Norton has had to work with the FAA without a statutory mandate to get more
community involvement in solving airplane noise issues at Reagan National
Airport (DCA), which is part of a metroplex with Dulles International and
Baltimore Washington International airports.  Last year, she held a community
airplane noise town hall with residents and officials from the FAA and the
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA).  Following that meeting,
Norton got MWAA to convene an airplane noise working group that includes D.C.
and Virginia residents and airline officials to make recommendations to the FAA
on flight paths.



 No New Planes at DCA; Flight Perimeter Stays Intact



 Norton defeated attempts to add additional large planes and airplane noise at
DCA to accommodate more flights outside the current 1,250 mile DCA perimeter.  A
Member withdrew his amendment to expand the perimeter for flights to his Corpus
Christie, TX hometown after Norton and Representative Barbara Comstock (R-VA)
reached out to their committee colleagues to urge them to oppose expanding the
perimeter, which would overburden an already crowded DCA.  Norton said that with
billions of taxpayer dollars already invested to expand Dulles, Members should
not introduce self-serving amendments to increase long-haul flights into DCA for
their personal convenience while the number of domestic passengers at Dulles has
decreased over the past eight years.



 Banning Use of Electronic Cigarettes and Vaping Devices on Airplanes



 One of the few Democratic amendments to attract Republican support was Norton's
amendment prohibiting the use of electronic cigarettes and vaping devices on
airplanes, which passed with bipartisan support.  She prevailed in spite of a
stunt by Representative Hunter Duncan (R-CA), who brought his vaporizer to the
hearing and vaped smoke used to simulate smoking into the face of his fellow
Republican, Representative Candice Miller (R-MI), who subsequently voted for the
Norton amendment.  Norton first introduced this provision as a standalone bill
last October after the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a rule
prohibiting passengers and crewmembers from carrying battery-powered portable
electronic smoking devices in checked baggage, which did not ban the use of
these vaping devices on airplanes.  Norton does not object to vaping, but vaping
nicotine or other vapor on an airplane that then circulates the vapor to others
would be both a health risk and a nuisance in a closed space.  She said that the
25-year-old ban against smoking on planes should apply to electronic cigarettes
and vaping devices as well.



 Continued Authorization of Equal Opportunity in Business Contracting



 Norton got the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, which provides
equality in contract opportunities for businesses owned by minorities, women,
and service-disabled veterans, to remain authorized in the bill.  The bill also
provides updated findings to support the constitutionality of the program.



 Reforming MWAA



 In response to several U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Inspector
General (IG) reports finding chronic problems with MWAA's auditing policies and
procedures, Norton has been pushing to get MWAA to adopt federal anti-nepotism
rules and generally accepted federal auditing standards.  Although Norton has
gotten MWAA to adopt accepted auditing standards and anti-nepotism rules, her
new FAA provision requires the DOT IG to conduct a study on MWAA's progress in
implementing the updated standards and to submit a report to Congress that
includes the findings, conclusions, and recommendations for strengthening and
improving MWAA's Office of Audit.

 In response to several U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Inspector
General (IG) reports finding chronic problems with MWAA's auditing policies and
procedures, Norton has been pushing to get MWAA to adopt federal anti-nepotism
rules and generally accepted federal auditing standards.  Although Norton has
gotten MWAA to adopt accepted auditing standards and anti-nepotism rules, her
new FAA provision requires the DOT IG to conduct a study on MWAA's progress in
implementing the updated standards and to submit a report to Congress that
includes the findings, conclusions, and recommendations for strengthening and
improving MWAA's Office of Audit.

Saints sponsor's battle with EU bosses

BYLINE: Andy Moffatt

LENGTH: 411  words","


A major e-cigarette company - and one of Saints main sponsors - have challenged
European Parliament directives of the devices.

Totally Wicked challenged the validity of Article 20 of the EU Tobacco Products
Directive (TPD) at the Court of Justice of the EU.

Totally Wicked is the only electronic cigarette manufacturer to challenge this
Directive which will bring e-cigarettes and e-liquid within its regulatory scope
as a ""tobacco related product"" - despite not containing tobacco - and subject
e-cigarettes to more stringent regulation than some tobacco products.

Totally Wicked's Council argued that Article 20 was a disproportionate
impediment to the free movement of goods and the free provision of services,
placed electronic cigarettes at an unjustified competitive disadvantage to
tobacco products, failed to comply with the general EU principle of equality,
and breached the fundamental rights of electronic cigarette manufacturers.

The Advocate General, who listened to the hearing, will publish her opinion on
December 17 with the final ruling expected in the New Year.

Fraser Cropper, Totally Wicked's managing director, said: ""Yesterday was a truly
historic day in the history of vaping.

""It was the culmination of a battle that has lasted more than two years.

""A battle between those who recognise the public health potential vaping offers
and therefore wish to see vaping flourish under a robust yet proportionate
consumer regulatory, and those who either do not understand vaping or see it as
a threat to established interests and therefore wish to see e-cigarettes
subjected to a disproportionate and inappropriate regulatory regime.

""It was disappointing to hear so many old and tired arguments in defence of
Article 20; arguments that I thought had been put to bed some time ago.

""I hope that the Advocate General and the Judges will look beyond this and make
a decision based on the points of law as articulated by our Council.

""If they do then I firmly believe that they will rule that Article 20 is
invalid.

""Since launching our legal challenge last year I have been heartened and
encouraged by the strength of support shown from the wider industry, but
importantly, from tens of thousands of vapers the length and breadth of Europe.

""This was exemplified by a couple from Bournemouth who drove all the way to
Luxembourg to support our legal challenge.  I would just like to put on record
my heartfelt thanks to all those who have supported us.""

COMPETING BILLS BAN OR PROTECT PUBLIC VAPING

BYLINE:  DAVID WAHLBERG  dwahlberg@madison.com, 608-252-6125

SECTION: FRONT; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 583 words","


Local governments could not broadly ban electronic cigarettes in public places,
as Madison did in January, under a bill to be introduced next week by a
Republican lawmaker.

Another bill introduced this week by a Democratic legislator would add
e-cigarettes, or vaping, to the state's indoor smoking ban.

The measures come amid growing use of e-cigarettes, battery-powered devices that
vaporize liquid nicotine. The devices aren't covered by the state's 2010 indoor
smoking ban.

Proponents of e-cigarettes say their lack of tar and carbon monoxide make them
healthier than regular cigarettes, but opponents say e-cigarettes contain heavy
metals and may be harmful to others. The opponents say smokers should use
medications, patches and gums, not e-cigarettes, to try to quit.

""The increasing popularity and marketing of electronic cigarettes has far
outpaced the scientific research necessary to deem them safe for either the
users or for those around them,"" the Wisconsin chapters of the American Cancer
Society Cancer Action Network, the American Heart Association and the American
Lung Association said in a statement.

A bill by Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, would prevent local governments
from banning e-cigarettes in buildings other than municipal property. The bill
would prohibit vaping statewide in hospitals, public or private elementary and
secondary schools, and child care centers when children are present.

Backed by taverns

The bill will be introduced next week, said Ashlee Moore, an aide to Kleefisch.
Moore said the bill has at least 15 Republican co-sponsors and is supported by
the Tavern League of Wisconsin and Johnson Creek Enterprises, a Hartland-based
manufacturer of vaping juices and other products.

""Municipalities all over our state are rushing to enact ordinances that force
companies to restrict the use of vaping devices and inexplicably place them in
the same category as regular tobacco cigarettes,"" Christian Berkey, CEO of
Johnson Creek Enterprises said in a letter Thursday to legislators.

The bill would overturn Madison's ban on e-cigarettes in most public places,
along with similar policies in Onalaska, Ashwaubenon and Greenfield, said Sara
Sahli with the Wisconsin chapter of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action
Network.

The bill could also impact a proposed change to Madison's zoning code. The
change would ban tobacco and e-cigarette retailers within 1,000 feet of schools,
day care centers, playgrounds, youth centers, parks, libraries and health care
facilities.

Ald. Lauren Cnare, who introduced the measure adding e-cigarettes to Madison's
smoking ban, said Kleefisch's bill would undermine local control and allow
people to be exposed to potentially harmful vapors that are unregulated and
largely unstudied.

""Each community knows best what it needs to do for its local residents,"" Cnare
said. ""It's good to be prudent about public health.""

A bill introduced Wednesday by Rep. Debra Kolste, D-Janesville, would include
vaping in the state smoking ban. The measure is co-sponsored by 11 Democrats and
one Republican, Rep. Scott Allen of Waukesha.

Allen is ""definitely against smoking of any kind,"" said his aide, Keith Best.

The cancer society, heart association and lung association, along with other
medical groups, oppose Kleefisch's bill. But they are staying neutral on
Kolste's bill.

The state smoking ban has been very effective, said Sahli, of the cancer
society. ""If we open it up, there's a possibility it could get weakened or
repealed,"" she said.

Vape `haram' for Muslims in Pahang

BYLINE: Nor Ain Mohamed Radhi

SECTION: Pg. 26

LENGTH: 237 words","


JERANTUT: THE Pahang Fatwa Council yesterday decreed that vaping is haram
(forbidden) for Muslims in the state.

Pahang Islamic Religious and Malay Customs Council (Muip) president Tengku
Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah said the decision was made after a syarak committee
meeting on Monday.

""The decision was made in accordance with the National Fatwa Council's decision
on Dec 21 which declared vape is haram. This is Pahang's stand (on vape),""
Tengku Abdullah said after chairing a council meeting here yesterday.

Muip deputy president Datuk Seri Wan Abdul Wahid Wan Hassan said vape use had
been forbidden at mosques and district religious offices since Jan 1. He said
Muip had also banned vaping at its premises.

""The ban is in line with the one issued by the Health Ministry, which bans
smoking in public areas.

""Apart from causing discomfort to those near them and harming one's health,
vaping is also a waste of money as a vaporiser device can cost hundreds of
ringgit, even thousands.""

Wan Abdul Wahid said it was up to the state government to decide whether or not
to ban vape in the state.

On Wednesday, the Negri Sembilan government had announced that vaping was haram
for Muslims but did not ban the sale of vape-related materials.

Johor became the first state to ban vape when Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim
Sultan Iskandar ordered the closure of premises selling vape equipment and
liquids at the beginning of this year.

Pennsylvania State Legislature Memoranda: Prohibiting Vaping in Indoor Public
Places

LENGTH: 280  words","

DATELINE: Harrisburg


Pennsylvania State Legislature has issued the following Memoranda updates:


In the near future, I plan to introduce legislation that would prohibit the use
of electronic cigarettes in indoor public places.



Lately, more and more smokers are turning to alternative nicotine products to
quit tobacco.  The most recent trend being vaping.  Vaping is the use of
electronic cigarettes--a battery-powered device that heats liquid nicotine into
a vapor, which is then inhaled by the user.  Supporters of electronic cigarettes
tout these devices as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes, however, the
FDA has yet to approve them as safe.  Until we fully understand the direct and
second-hand effects of electronic cigarette vapor, I believe we should err on
the side of caution with respect to where the products are used in public.

Therefore, my legislation amends the Clean Indoor Air Act to prohibit electronic
cigarettes and related products from being used in public places.  Under the
provisions of my bill, the exemptions afforded for the use of tobacco products
in certain public places would be extended to the use of electronic cigarettes.
This bill is part of a legislative package I am sponsoring to address the risks
associated with electronic cigarettes and liquid nicotine.

As members of the General Assembly, our number one goal is to keep
Pennsylvanian's safe.  By ensuring vaping is treated like smoking, we can better
protect non-smokers and non-vapers from any potential hazards of second hand
vapor.  Please join me in co-sponsoring this legislation.

The Digital Smoker opens in Georgetown

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 307  words","


By now, you've probably heard about e-cigarettes, but you're not sure what to
make of them.

And that's exactly why we started The Digital Smoker. To educate and support
smokers who want to get poisonous tobacco out of their lives. Smoker or
non-smoker, you probably know someone who needs to quit, and there's a lot of
conflicting information out there that makes it hard to know where to start with
any degree of confidence.

At The Digital Smoker, we get it. We're all former smokers who made the
transition, and now we teach others about the world of vaping. Our friendly,
knowledgeable staff is always ready to sit and spend the time with anyone who
wants to learn, whether you're a smoker or the friend/relative/wife/husband of a
smoker who just wants to know the benefits.

Our first store opened in Port Credit in July 2014, and we recently opened our
second store in Georgetown at 158 Guelph St. in July of this year. Our warm and
inviting stores have lounges for you to sit and sample any of our 200-plus
flavours and we're always happy to recommend something.

Our customers have had tremendous success in ridding tobacco from their lives
because they receive proper training, can ask as many questions as needed, and
they know they have after-sale support when and if they ever need help. We take
customer service very seriously and that's probably why The Digital Smoker was
voted one of the top 3 vape shops in Ontario.

We're also here to provide the truth about vaping. And the truth is that every
legitimate, peer-reviewed study has found vaping to be a safer alternative,
including a recent study from the British government that concluded vaping to be
at least 95% less harmful than smoking.

We're trying to save the 40,000 Canadians who die from smoking every year, one
smoker at a time.

No work ban on e-cigarettes due to poor evidence

SECTION: IRELAND

LENGTH: 446 words","


It is understood that the Department of Health found it was not able to include
the vaping devices in the workplace ban because the evidence of the harm they
caused was not strong enough.

The department has said current evidence did not support prohibiting
e-cigarettes in public places but individual organisations and businesses were
free to introduce an e-cigarette-free policy.

The ICS had been hoping that e-cigarettes would be included in the workplace
smoking ban when legislation to transpose the EU Tobacco Products Directive was
introduced next year.

While it is clear that e-cigarettes are far less harmful than tobacco smoking,
we are concerned that the success of the 11-year-old workplace smoking ban in
de-normalising smoking may be undermined by not extending it to vaping,  the ICS
stated.

The society is concerned that the current situation regarding e-cigarettes
creates a legal limbo for individual businesses, some of which have already
decided to prohibit vaping in the same way as tobacco.

Research commissioned by the ICS earlier this year showed that over half (53%)
of the Irish public would support the inclusion of e-cigarettes in the smoking
ban.

The ICS pointed out that Wales and Portugal were both planning to extend their
smoking bans to cover vaping.

We will be calling for the Department of Health to reconsider their position as
they draft the first regulations on e-cigarettes which are due to be in place by
May 2016,  it added.

The department said it would continue to monitor evidence on the potential harms
and any benefits of e-cigarettes.

In the meantime, while more research was awaited on the harms and benefits,
there was a need to ensure that there was some regulation of e-cigarettes.

It said the Government had approved the drafting of legislation to introduce a
licensing system for e-cigarettes.

The legislation would also prohibit the sale of the products to and by persons
under 18 years of age.

The department is also working on transposing the revised EU Tobacco Products
Directive into national law. It provides for the regulation of certain aspects
of e-cigarettes across the EU.

The directive will set safety and quality requirements and make health warnings
and information leaflets obligatory.

The directive also gives the EU the power to prohibit any electronic cigarette
or refill cartridges if concern is raised regarding an unforeseen risk to public
health.

In August, Public Health England, an agency of Britain s Department of Health
backed the use of e-cigarettes because they were 95% safer than smoking tobacco.

It suggested that e-cigarettes could one day be offered alongside nicotine
patches as a smoking cessation aid.

EDITORIAL: Editorial - Too soon to crush e-cigarette businesses in state with
high taxes

BYLINE: Walla Walla Union-Bulletin, Wash.

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 404 words","


March 18--Electronic cigarettes were in the Legislature's cross hairs Monday as
lawmakers pondered Gov. Jay Inslee's proposal to essentially tax them out of
existence.

Should lawmakers pull the trigger?

Not just yet. The health risks of e-cigarettes or ""vaping"" are still being
researched and debated.

Adding a 95 percent tax, the same that is imposed on tobacco products, would
crush the relatively young industry.

But it makes sense to look at the issue now and impose some reasonable
restrictions in regard to minors using the product.

""It's a completely unregulated industry without any sort of standards or
inspections,"" Grant County Health District Administrator Jeff Ketchel told a
House committee, ""and not any sort of requirements for labeling.""

The goal of House Bill 1645, pitched by the governor, is to curb the increasing
popularity of ""vaping"" among teenagers.

Along with taxing vaping products such as e-cigarettes, the proposal would
create a law against minors buying e-cigarettes, prohibit flavored vapor
products and require all e-cigarette products to come in child-resistant
packaging. The Senate approved a similar bill earlier this month.

Given that more than 100 calls were made to the state's poison control hotline
in 2014 because young children swallowing vaping fluid, not selling to minors
and child-proof packaging should be approved.

Not allowing flavors for adults is premature. Those who use e-cigarettes to quit
smoking tobacco products apparently enjoy the various flavors offered.

One of those folks who testified before the committee said finding the right
flavor helped him quit smoking. He does, however, have a business interest in
e-cigarettes as he owns Future Vapor, a Seattle store.

""As soon as I was introduced to vapor products and found my flavor, I was able
to quit that day,"" said Zach McLain, a tobacco smoker for 25 years.

Switching from tobacco to vapor might be a boon to McLain's health; then again,
it might not. We know tobacco smoke kills; the long-term health effects of vapor
are not fully known.

Those who invested in e-cigarette shops should not be driven out of business
through taxation.

Let's take a slow and thoughtful approach to the growing e-cigarette business to
do what's best in the long run.

Will e-cigs be a smoking gun?;
DEBATE OVER INCREASE IN 'VAPING'

BYLINE: EMILY FAIRBAIRN; LYNSEY HOPE

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 869 words","


EVER since e-cigarettes went on sale in 2007, Britain has been huffing and
puffing about whether or not ""vaping"" is a good thing.

Some say they help quitters while others say they ""normalise"" smoking and
encourage kids to take up the habit. Either way UK sales are booming, rising by
340 per cent to £193billion in 2013 with an estimated 1.3million users.

But their use is largely unregulated. Yesterday The Sun told how gran Jean Booth
was left fighting for her life in a fire after allegedly trying to light an
e-cig. So should we steam on, or is it time for a rethink?

Here EMILY FAIRBAIRN and LYNSEY HOPE present the Great British Vape Off.

Is vaping dangerous?

E-CIGS work by vaporising liquid nicotine, and delivering a hit to the lungs
without the killer tar and toxins found in normal cigarette smoke.

With almost 100,000 smoking-related deaths in the UK every year, advocates argue
that e-cigarettes could save millions of lives by offering an alternative to
harmful tobacco.

But the jury is out on whether e-cigarettes are completely safe.

Until new legislation comes into force in 2016, there is no regulation of the
substances found in the ""vape"". The longterm health risks of these chemicals are
unknown.

Meanwhile, some health experts say we should be trying to wean people off
addictive nicotine. Research shows 11 per cent of smokers use e-cigs alongside
their normal cigarette habit.

There are also fears that vaping both normalises and glamorises smoking -
arguments used by the Welsh government last month when proposing a ban on e-cig
use in public places.

And it's not just health concerns - fire chiefs are also worried that smokers
are unaware of risks.

What's in an e-cig?

EACH device consists of a battery, a cartridge filled with nicotine, a solution
of propylene glycol or glycerine mixed with water, and an atomiser to turn the
solution into a vapour.

The exact contents of an e-cig varies from brand to brand, but there can be up
to 4,000 chemicals in each, some potentially cancercausing. These include
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein and certain metals. French researcher
Thomas Laurenceau, who published a study on carcinogenic chemicals found in many
e-cig brands, said: ""Some e-cigarettes can deliver potentially toxic compounds
in vapours.

""Some e-cigarettes we tested deliver levels equivalent to or higher than some
cigarettes. It is clear smoking cigarettes with tobacco can cause cancer and
these e-cigarettes contain similar levels of some of the same poisons.""

E-cigs often come with additives and flavourings, such as chocolate, fruit,
coffee, menthol or tobacco.

Who is smoking them?

RESEARCH shows e-cigarette use is almost entirely confined to current or
ex-smokers.

It found 35 per cent of tobacco smokers have tried them, and 11 per cent
currently use them. Celebrity fans include Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Moss, both
left. Cheryl Cole and Lily Allen also use them Snoop Dogg is marketing his own
vapouriser pen. An increasing number of teens are experimenting with e-cigs,
raising fears they could be using the devices as a ""gateway"" into nicotine
addiction.

A US study of nearly 40,000 youngsters found e-cigarette use among school
students doubled to 6.5 per cent between 2011 and 2012. Teens who had tried an
e-cig were six times more likely to smoke traditional ciggies.

Teen vaper Ella Williams, 18, said: ""For now e-cigarettes are quite cool because
you can smoke them indoors, and there is no smell - so it's good to do with your
friends on a night out.""

WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

WHILE cigarettes are subject to punishing tax and duty, with e-cigarettes only
VAT applies - meaning bumper profits for the manufacturers.

A single cigarette selling for about 40p has 36p tax and duty, leaving just 10
per cent for the maker.

An e-cig is 2p a smoke.

Just 0.33p is VAT and no duty applies, meaning sales are worth 80 per cent.

The Treasury earned £12.1billion from tobacco duties and tax in the 2011-2012
financial year.

Receipts from e-cigarettes are minimal - and traditional tobacco giants are
rushing to join in.

FOR

Professor ROBERT WEST Professor of Health Psychology and Director of Tobacco
Studies at University College London

A RECENT expert panel judged e-cigarettes to be at least 20 times safer than
cigarettes. There can be no doubt that if every smoker switched to them it would
save tens of thousands of lives every year.

Some argue they encourage kids to start smoking, but so far the evidence does
not bear this out.

Very few people use them who have never smoked. More smokers are stopping and
there is no sign of more young people starting to smoke.

AGAINST

Doctor RAM MOORTHY Spokesman for the British Medical Association

AS doctors we are very concerned about e-cigarettes and specifically about their
safety. So we welcome legislation making them subject to regulation.

However, this doesn't come into force until 2016 and we think it should happen
much sooner than that. Another concern is that e-cigarettes are normalising
smoking behaviour, just when the smoking ban has started to succeed in making
smoking socially unacceptable.

We want to see legislation banning e-cig sales to under-18s brought in as soon
as possible and strongly enforced.

A cloud over vaping

BYLINE: Ashley Booker, The Hutchinson News, Kan.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 948 words","


July 18--As federal regulators are looking into warning the public about
e-cigarette dangers, local businesses are already asking residents not to use
them.

On June 30, federal regulators began seeking information to warn the public
about liquid nicotine exposure dangers -- specifically for infants and children
-- and requiring some liquid nicotine- or nicotine-containing products be sold
in child-resistant packaging.

Their requests come from seeing a correlation between e-cigarette popularity and
more poison control center calls and ER visits related to liquid nicotine
poisoning and other exposure risks, according to the FDA's website.

E-cigarettes convert nicotine-containing liquid into a smokable vapor.

Possible regulations may come from what the FDA receives between now and Aug.
31. If this happens, the public will be able to comment on it, according to its
website.

The FDA hasn't released regulations on e-cigarettes despite saying it's about to
release the findings, said Spencer Duncan, representative for the Kansas Vapors
Association.

""As an industry, we are still waiting. They keep moving the goal post,"" Duncan
said.

While he suspects the FDA has determined what regulations it wishes to impose
without releasing them, Duncan's heard it's waiting on e-cigarette studies.

Although Duncan believes the industry won't like all of the regulations, it at
least wants to see them and work to change them if necessary.

Comments have already been sent to the FDA by the Kansas Vapors Association,
vapor businesses and the Hutch Vapor Shop, said owner Carrie Stewart.

""We absolutely think the FDA should regulate. We want all of those guidelines
put in place so that we can protect ourselves as an industry and a community,""
Stewart said.

It's important that children don't have access to e-cigarettes and that they
don't use vaping as a means to smoke, she added.

Her business has put child restraints and safety seals on all of their juices
and refuses to sell to anyone under 18.

She's even had to throw a few parents out for acting as if they were getting
products for their children.

While her business is taking extra precautions, she says the industry has been
regulating itself as well.

As of July 1, a new cigarette tax increased a pack of cigarettes 50 cents, and
come next July, an excise tax of 20 cents per milliliter will be imposed on the
liquid used for e-cigarettes and vaping pens.

The Kansas Vapors Association is trying to fight the tax before it goes into
effect because of its vague language, Duncan said.

He said it's hard to know if it will tax the juice, amount of nicotine per
milliliter or per the bottle. There are just too many unanswered questions.

With stakeholder input, the department of revenue will make enforcement
decisions on the tax, Duncan said.

He said lawmakers tacked on the e-cigarette part of the tax bill toward the end
of the session without a committee hearing, and it made Kansas the third state
in the country to tax e-cigarettes.

If the product is taxed overall, it's a 50 percent tax increase, and the way the
law is written also collects the new sales tax, making e-cigarette products more
costly than traditional tobacco products, Duncan said.

""We are making the healthier product more costly than the harmful product.
That's a big concern for us,"" Duncan said, and it's something he will fight.

Instead of creating a ""knee-jerk reaction,"" Duncan hopes the FDA will wait for
the study results to regulate the industry.

While the health benefits or disadvantages of e-cigarettes and vaping are being
debated, local businesses are already asking residents not to use them.

Karen Leshure, owner of Skaets Steak Shop, said there's been a few instances
when the restaurant employees have asked customers not to use them.

In all instances, the customers have been courteous to stop.

Although Leshure says the restaurant doesn't have many problems, and she isn't
putting signs up, the same can't be said for Carl's Bar and Delicatessen.

The owner of the bar, Pam Heimerman, says they are probably going to put up
signs saying they aren't allowed.

She's not really crazy about them and says there isn't much information on
whether the vapor causes problems for either users or non-users.

While Stewart says many bars lose money when their customers step outside to
smoke, she respects restaurants asking people not to use them.

For those who do vape, she said she believes they have the responsibility to not
be offensive and obnoxious to bystanders when vaping.

The phrase, ""there's not enough research,"" is a saying the industry hears when
it comes to backlash against its products, Stewart said.

""If they want to come into the shop, I will make research completely available
to them,"" Stewart said.

Although research has been conducted around e-cigarettes, researchers are
inconclusive as to what risks are associated, how much nicotine is harmful or if
there are benefits with e-cigarettes, according to the FDA.

Although Duncan says he wouldn't suggest nonsmokers take up vaping, because
frankly ""they aren't healthy,"" he does say they are a better alternative for
heavy smokers to get off of traditional products.

Hutch Vapor Shop has seen heavy smokers who wean themselves off of harmful
traditional tobacco products by using e-cigarettes, by decreasing the amount of
nicotine in their juice over time, Stewart said.

""They come in here to quit; it works,"" Stewart said. ""It's easy for people to
taper down.""

Stewart even has doctors sending patients into her Hutchinson, Salina and
Wellington stores.

Don't stub out this great way to quit smoking;
E-cigarettes will save lives if we keep them out of the itching regulatory hands
of the health nannies

BYLINE: Matt Ridley

SECTION: EDITORIAL; OPINION, COLUMNS; Pg. 29

LENGTH: 1037 words","


Should shampoo be classified as medicine and prescribed by doctors? It can,
after all, cause harm: it stings your eyes and a recent study found traces of
carcinogens in 98 shampoo products. Sure, it can clean hair if used responsibly.
But what's to stop cowboy shampoo makers selling dangerous shampoo to the young?
Far too many shampoo manufacturers try to glamorise their product. Time for the
State to step in.

Far fetched? If only. This week the European Parliament sensibly declined to
accept the European Commission's directive to regulate as medicines those
glowing-tipped electronic nicotine vapour dispensers called e-cigarettes. The
British Government, astonishingly, expressed disappointment and intends to treat
e-cigarettes as medicines from 2016.

""We believe these products need to be regulated as medicines and will continue
to make this point during further negotiations,"" the Department of Health said.
Who's ""we"", by the way? All the signs are that ""vaping"" is rapidly gaining
market share from smoking. Having begun in China in the early 2000s,
e-cigarettes have sales of more than £2 billion this year, with the number of
users doubling in some parts of the world in the past year or so. Big tobacco
companies are rushing to acquire Chinese start-ups or their knowhow, a sure sign
that they expect to lose customers to vaping. And they will: vaping helps people
to stop smoking.

Examine the evidence and you find that e-cigarettes save far more lives than
shampoo, and probably do no more harm. A recent New Zealand study, published by
The Lancet, split 657 smokers into three categories; a third used nicotine
patches, a third e-cigarettes and a third fake (placebo) e-cigarettes.
E-cigarette smokers were more likely to abstain from smoking entirely, more
likely to halve cigarette use if they didn't quit entirely, and three times more
likely to continue with the product afterwards.

Meanwhile a thorough search for medical threats from inhaling nicotine vapour -
as opposed to smoke - finds very little. Nitrosamine and formaldehyde levels are
1,000 times lower than in cigarette smoke. Dose matters in toxicity. Even a
former director of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) has described vaping as ""a
very low-risk alternative to cigarettes, used by smokers as a pleasurable way of
taking the relatively harmless recreational drug nicotine''. There's moderately
good preliminary evidence that nicotine helps to slow the progression of
Alzheimer's, so it might even do good.

None the less, all round the world the health nannies are itching to get their
regulatory hands on e-cigarettes. In a dozen countries, mainly in Latin America,
they are banned altogether (presumably after subtle lobbying by tobacco farmers
and the cigarette industry). Here the ""NHS Choices"" website magnanimously
concedes that until they are regulated in 2016, the medicines and healthcare
products regulatory agency ""will not ban the products entirely... but will
encourage e-cigarette manufacturers to apply for a medicine licence"". Meanwhile,
it warns, e-cigarettes ""are only covered by product safety legislation"".

The NHS recommends instead a white, bulbous thing called a nicotine inhalator,
which is a ""licensed quit smoking aid, available on the NHS, [that] consists of
just a mouthpiece and a plastic cartridge"". Somehow, I don't think they've got
the hang of glamorised marketing. But if they concede the principle that
nicotine inhalers are safe and should be made available to people at taxpayers'
expense, why are they trying to regulate the sale of devices that, at no cost to
the taxpayer, do almost the same thing but might actually look cool in the
street? I cannot help feeling that the Department of Health is more interested
in retaining control of the nicotine market than promoting health. This is known
in economics as regulatory www.capture.Be in no doubt that regulating
e-cigarettes as a medicine would kill people. It would discourage their use by
raising the cost of launching, selling and monitoring them and would make them
harder to buy. Given that we know they help people to stop smoking, it would,
therefore, kill. As so often, the precautionary principle, by weighing the costs
but not the benefits of a new technology, does net harm.

Vaping costs much less than smoking, not least because it is untaxed, so is
bound to spread fairly fast. It could overtake smoking within a decade, some
think. Frankly, we should change the regulations to encourage it: it should be
allowed indoors, as a further incentive to help smokers to quit. E-cigarette
makers should be allowed to advertise (which this week's European Parliament
vote prevented) to help them to grab market share faster. So what if this leads
to a ""reglamorising"" of people putting cylinders between their lips? ""We""
objected to smoking because it hurt people, not because it was glamorous.

Passive vaping is also far more pleasant than passive smoking, for the simple
reason that it obeys John Stuart Mill's harm principle: that you can do what you
like unless it harms others. This concept used to elude smokers in the old days,
when some were, for my taste, too addictively oblivious to how much discomfort
their smoke, ash and stale smell caused to others. There is simply no sensible
reason to object to somebody vaping - even on an aeroplane.

The addiction we should worry about is that of regulators to harmful regulation.
America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month said it was
deeply troubling that e-cigarette use among American teenagers has doubled, even
though less than 10 per cent of the users had never smoked a real cigarette -
ie, most were probably cutting their risk of death. Yet justice officials from
40 American states have demanded that the Food and Drug Administration regulate
vaping. It would have done by the end of this month if the Government had not
shut down.

By the way, if you are now worried about shampoo, don't be. Coffee and organic
broccoli have more carcinogens in them than most chemical products. That does
not make them dangerous. It's all about dose.

Vaping little danger to bystanders, Letter Jan. 4

Some questions for PhD student Amelia Howard, who suggests that there is not
enough research to ban indoor smoking of fake cigarettes, or ""vaping."" Is that
not what the tobacco companies said about real cigarettes until just a few years
ago?

Won't young children watching people smoking in restaurants and shopping malls
want to try it also? What about reformed smokers watching ""vapeurs"" and fondly
remembering the pleasures of smoking? Will they not crave a smoke, and return to
the addiction?

UK e-cigarette firm fights EU vaping laws in European court;
Blackburn-based Totally Wicked says European Union plans to heavily regulate
industry and treat it like tobacco will stifle research and growth

BYLINE: James Meikle

SECTION: SOCIETY

LENGTH: 462 words","


A British company is taking its challenge against EU proposals on e-cigarette
production, sales and marketing to the European court of justice.

Totally Wicked, based in Blackburn, Lancashire, will argue before the Luxembourg
court on Thursday that rules due to come into force next year are
""disproportionate and inappropriate"".

The company complains that e-cigarettes are being covered by a new tobacco
directive despite the fact they do not contain tobacco. It also says that the
future of the nicotine-based products, employing an increasing variety of
shapes, sizes and flavours, will be put at risk when they have only recently
been endorsed by Public Health England as 95% less harmful than tobacco
cigarettes.

Totally Wicked, which also operates in the US and Germany, says e-cigarettes are
a revolutionary product and left to develop under proportionate regulation have
the potential to render tobacco obsolete.

But it argues limits on the size of bottles of e-liquids, restrictions on
nicotine strengths and curbs on advertising and sponsorship, among other
measures, will not only damage an emerging industry but make it liable to more
stringent regulation than some tobacco products.

Fraser Cropper, the company's managing director, said the legal challenge in
Luxembourg was the culmination of a ""battle between those who recognise the
public health potential vaping offers ... and those who either do not understand
vaping, or see it as a threat to established interests and therefore wish to see
e-cigarettes subjected to a disproportionate and inappropriate regulatory
regime"".

But Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy at the campaigning charity Action on
Smoking and Health, said: ""Good regulation is important to drive up standards.
Elsewhere in the world countries are opting to ban e-cigarettes.

""In Europe we will have a balanced model of regulation that will keep safe and
effective products on the market. There is also much scope for improvement. We
know that two out of three smokers who try e-cigarettes do not continue vaping.
Balanced regulation can drive innovation and improve the market as a whole.""

An estimated 2.6m adults in the UK now use e-cigarettes. The Royal Society for
Public Health argued days before the PHE verdict that vaping was safer than
smoking and that a less negative attitude towards e-cigarettes by officials
could provide a way of helping people with a nicotine addiction wean themselves
off the more dangerous tar- and arsenic-containing tobacco. NHS stop smoking
services should be more ready to use them, it said.

However evidence for the PHE position, announced last month, has since been
criticised in both the Lancet and British Medical Journal.

A decision on the Totally Wicked challenge is not expected until early next
year.

Arvada bans public use of e-cigs, puts vapes under code

BYLINE: Austin Briggs

SECTION: ASECTION; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 254 words","


ARVADA The City Council has passed an ordinance banning the use of electronic
cigarettes in public places.

Late Monday, the council voted 5 2 to place the devices under the tobacco code,
which means the same laws that apply to traditional tobacco products will apply
to electronic delivery systems, including e cigarettes and vaporizers.

Council members Bob Fifer and Don Allard voted ""no.""

The vote also added taxicabs, light rail trains, vans and public transit
platforms to the definition of a public place.

Dozens of people spoke out Monday night. Electronic cigarette supporters said
they are a tool to help smokers quit and pose little public risk. Opponents said
they can be used to hide illegal narcotics and the risks are still unknown.

Resident John Malito said other cities have banned the devices, and if Arvada
failed to do so, it could become a vaping mecca.

""I'm afraid Arvada could become a vaping destination and we would see the
proliferation of hookah lounges,"" he said.

A handful of residents, including a few owners of vaping businesses, said they
supported parts of the ordinance, including not selling to youths and using the
devices in public.

They pleaded with the council, however, to remove a section of the ordinance
prohibiting the use of the devices in any tobacco related business, meaning
customers couldn't test different e juice flavors or devices in the stores.

Council members debated for about an hour after public comment and voted for an
exemption allowing use of the devices in vaping businesses.

Bloomington may crack down on e-cigarette use

BYLINE: JOHN REINAN; STAFF WRITER, STAR TRIBUNE (Mpls.-St. Paul)

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 480 words","



HIGHLIGHT: The city is considering ""vaping"" restrictions that are tougher than
current state law.


Bloomington may join a growing list of Minnesota cities that have cracked down
on e-cigarette use in public places. The City Council is set to vote on a tough
ordinance that would restrict ""vaping"" beyond what state law requires.

At its Nov. 17 meeting, the council will hear public comments and is expected to
vote on a proposal to ban e-cigarette use in most public places. If adopted, the
ordinance would outlaw vaping lounges, which typically sell e-cigarette supplies
and offer a place for vapers to ""smoke"" together.

Stores could still sell e-cigarettes and supplies, but users could no longer
""light up"" on the premises. Earlier this year, the Minnesota Legislature passed
a law that puts some restrictions on public use of e-cigarettes but does not ban
their use in bars, restaurants and many other public places. Some parts of the
law took effect July 1, while others will take effect Jan. 1.

However, cities are free to pass their own ordinances, and many have done so -
often modeling them after the state's Clean Indoor Air Act, which is much more
restrictive than the state's e-cigarette law. St. Paul, Edina, St. Anthony and
Savage are among the cities that have imposed restrictions on e-cigarettes.
Minneapolis is considering tougher restrictions but hasn't acted yet.

Angie Griffith is a co-owner of Smokeless Smoking, which was among the earliest
e-cigarette retailers in Minnesota. Griffith operates vaping lounges in
Minneapolis, Woodbury, Burnsville and Bloomington. She said the tough
restrictions would not only hurt her business, but also potentially harm people
who might use e-cigarettes as an aid to stop smoking regular cigarettes.

Griffith is circulating petitions in support of e-cigarette use and recently
collected more than 250 customer testimonials that she compiled into a book,
""The Faces of Smokeless Smoking,"" which was sent to Bloomington City Council
members.

""We'd like them to follow the state's lead,"" Griffith said. ""At the very least,
we'd like them to amend it so we could use our own products in our own store.""

Bloomington health officials have been working on the proposed ordinance since
April, said Bonnie Paulson, the city's public health administrator. Concerns
about youthful users are a driving factor, she said. On Monday, the state
released a teen smoking study showing that 28 percent of Minnesota high
schoolers have tried e-cigarettes, with 13 percent having used one within the
previous 30 days.

""One of the big concerns with the City Council is related to keeping youth from
using tobacco,"" Paulson said. Widespread vaping ""is kind of a normalization that
this is something people choose to do.""

Paulson said ""there's still not quite enough research out there"" on the health
effects of vaping. But, she said, ""there are chemicals and nicotine and other
byproducts in that vapor. It's not just water vapor.""

Raising smoking age gets new push;
58 cities ban sales to anyone under 21.Gov. Kasich seeks tax hike on tobacco
products.;
COLUMBUS BUREAU

BYLINE: By Laura A. Bischoff

Business owner Rabi Ahmed opposes a tax hike on cigarettes and e-cigarettes at
his Smokers Plus Vapes Discount Tobacco Shop on Wilmington Pike.

Business owner Rabi Ahmed does not believe a tax hike will keep customers away
from his Smokers Plus Vapes Discount Tobacco Shop on Wilmington Pike. A study
found last year that more teens use e-cigarettes than traditional tobacco
cigarettes or any other tobacco product.

Fairborn resident Torrance Smith spends about $150 a month on cigarettes. He
supports raising the legal age for buying cigarettes. ""I'd deal with that
because I started when I was young. I don't think young people really should
smoke like that ""

COLUMBUS - Public health advocates want to bump the legal age for buying tobacco
to 21 and they're starting with city councils across Ohio - not state lawmakers
- to make the case.

Dr. Rob Crane, an Ohio State University associate professor of family medicine
and president of the Preventing Tobacco Addiction Foundation, is meeting with
local officials in the Columbus area and elsewhere to convince them to adopt
ordinances prohibiting tobacco sales to anyone under 21. So far, 58 cities in
seven states across the country - including New York City - have taken such
steps but none in Ohio, according to Crane.

Crane notes that a decade ago he lobbied cities such as Toledo and Columbus to
adopt indoor smoking bans, which cracked the door open for a voter-initiated
statute that banned indoor smoking statewide.

Crane said raising the tobacco age would reduce smoking among adolescents,
similar to how alcohol use among teens dropped after states raised the drinking
age to 21.

""Nearly all adult smokers began smoking by the age of 18 - almost no one starts
smoking after 21,"" according to a study Crane and OSU College of Public Health
released earlier this month.

Ohio has a higher rate of smokers than the national average. In Ohio, 23.4
percent of adults smoke regularly, compared with 19 percent of American adults,
and 15.1 percent of high school students smoke, compared with 15.7 percent of
American high school students, according to 2013 figures from the Center for
Disease Control.

In Needham, Mass., which implemented a tobacco 21 law in 2005, youth smoking
rates dropped because the ordinance effectively blocked social sources that had
been providing tobacco to Needham high school students, Crane reported.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Institute of Medicine released a
report Thursday that said raising the tobacco purchase age to 21 across the
nation would reduce smoking prevalence by 13 percent, result in 249,000 fewer
smoking-related deaths down the road and lead to 286,000 fewer pre-term births
and 438,000 fewer low-weight births.

taxes Raising cigarette

Ohio Gov. John Kasich is not interested in pushing the tobacco purchase age to
21, according to Kasich press secretary Rob Nichols. But the governor is pushing
tax changes in his state budget bill that experts say will help reduce youth
smoking rates.

Kasich is calling for the first cigarette tax hike in a decade, bumping it to
$2.25 per pack, up from $1.25, starting July 1. Additionally, he wants to
increase taxes on other tobacco products such as chewing tobacco to 60 percent
of the wholesale price, up from the current 17 percent on most products and the
current 37 percent on little cigars.

And Kasich wants e-cigarettes, or vaping products, taxed at the same rate as
regular tobacco cigarettes beginning Jan. 1, 2016. A ""cigarette equivalent""
would be calculated for products that contain nicotine in any concentration and
taxed at 11.25 cents per cigarette equivalent, according to Kasich's budget
bill.

e Impact -cigarettes on vaping,

The idea of taxing vaping products such as tobacco isn't going over well in
shops that sell the liquid nicotine and electronic cigarettes.

""I don't agree that that's any equivalent to a cigarette. I mean the health
risks in cigarettes compared to vaping? You can't compare those. It's so much
better to vape. That's my personal opinion, other people don't agree with that,""
said Justin Woleslagle, of Dayton, a tattoo artist and vape user.

Chris Voudris, co-owner VaporHaus, added: ""I do not think the tax is fair
because honestly when there is 4,000 additives in a cigarette and it has been
proven to kill you, how can you tax an e-cigarette the same way, when it has not
been proven to have the same effects.""

VaporHaus has three stores in the area in Dayton, Kettering and Fairfield.

The increased tobacco, cigarette and vaping taxes are projected to generate an
additional $991 million over two years for the state budget, according to the
Legislative Service Commission analysis. The budget proposal is being debated in
the Ohio House Finance Committee.

Vaping, which uses battery-powered devices with heating elements to produce a
vapor for users to inhale, is gaining popularity with youths. Liquid nicotine
used in the devices comes in hundreds of flavors that appeal to children, such
as bubble gum, Captain Crunch and chocolate.

A University of Michigan study found last year that more teens use e-cigarettes
than traditional tobacco cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The annual
study has tracked substance use trends among students in eighth, tenth and
twelfth grades for the past 40 years. The study found teens don't believe
e-cigarettes harm health.

Patrick Fleenor, an economist for Altria, which is one of the largest tobacco
companies in the world, testified against Kasich's tax proposals, saying Ohio
would be relying on an unpredictable revenue stream, it could lead to smuggling
and cross-border purchasing, and it would force smokers to pay more than their
fair share of taxes.

Fleenor also argued against Ohio instituting a new tax on vaping.

""Taxing e-vapor products is misguided. First, e-vapor products may present a
compelling harm reduction opportunity compared to combustible cigarettes and tax
policy should not dissuade adult consumers from migrating to an alternative
product,"" he said in written testimony before the Ohio House. States should wait
for the FDA to regulate e-cigarettes before jumping in with new taxes, he
argued.

The American Vaping Association criticized Kasich's vape tax, saying it would
jack the retail prices up by 150 percent. And as far as raising the tobacco and
vaping purchase age to 21 goes, AVA president Greg Conley said: "" If young men
and women can go off and fight in foreign wars (at age 18), they should be free
to purchase low-risk, smoke-free nicotine products.""

Dr. Crane said there is no long-term evidence that vaping will be safer than
regular cigarettes.

""Remember Big Tobacco said that filters on cigarettes would make them safer -
wrong. Then they claimed low-tar cigarettes were safer - worse than wrong. Now
shady importers reap huge profits bringing unregulated vape liquid from China,
and want us to believe it's safe. Really? Adults can be gullible if they want,
but please, keep this addictive junk well away from our kids.""

Torrance Smith of Fair-born spends about $150 a month on cigarettes - a habit he
says he picked up at age 14 or 15.

Smith said raising the tobacco purchase age is a better idea than increasing
taxes.

""I'd deal with that because I started when I was young. I don't think young
people really should smoke like that,"" Smith said. ""I see a lot of kids in my
neighborhood that be smoking and I be looking like 'Man, you all too young for
that ... you all ruin you all life at a young age.' I wish I never started when
I was young honestly because I probably wouldn't be smoking right now.""

Fact #2: Cigarette makers Altria Group, Reynolds American and others are getting
a boost from a surprising factor: lower oil prices.

Fact #3: Gas-station convenience stores are where most Americans stock up on
cigarettes, according to Adam Fleck, director of consumer equity research at
Morningstar.

The crash in oil has driven down gasoline prices. That, in turn, has coaxed
Americans to hit the road. More Americans stopping to fill up with cheap gas
moves more cigarettes out the door.

But while nothing complements a hard-raging road trip like a pack of smokes, the
fall in gas prices isn't enough to counteract the declining number of Americans
who spend time in Marlboro country. The percentage of U.S. adults who smoke hit
a new low during the first quarter -- 15.2% -- according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. That's down from more than 25% in the mid-1990
s.

Fleck doesn't see that trend reversing.

Higher Prices, More Vapor

When drugstore giant CVS Health ended its sales of cigarettes and other tobacco
products last year, the number of cigarette packs sold at all retailers in the
U.S. fell by 95 million, according to a CVS report using data from market
research firm IRI. Rivals Walgreens and Wal-Mart aren't following CVS' lead, but
are instead promoting nicotine gum, patches and other products to help current
smokers quit.

As smoking rates fall, tobacco companies have managed to boost revenue by
increasing cigarette prices. Altria, which controls more than 40% of the U.S.
cigarette market and makes the top-selling brand Marlboro, has posted revenue
gains in the last three quarters along with double-digit EPS gains.

But price increases can only go so far. So tobacco companies are looking at
alternative products to attract millennials attuned to the negative effects of
smoking, as well as current cigarette smokers seeking what's perceived as a
healthier alternative.

Vaping has gained popularity in recent years. Electronic cigarettes, also called
vaporizers, heat mixtures of nicotine, flavors -- like honeysuckle or cotton
candy -- and other chemicals into an inhalable mist. Health officials are so far
on the fence as to whether the practice of vaping is actually safer than smoking
traditional cigarettes. Around the country, vaping has started to be banned
indoors, as well as in some outdoor spaces, like parks.

Altria's e-cig business includes MarkTen and Green Smoke brands. Reynolds
American markets VUSE brand products. As of Q2, VUSE products were in 100,000
retail outlets in the U.S., and the brand has gotten a boost from local
marketing campaigns, Reynolds American said in its earnings conference call.

Defense Vs. A Choppy Market

Despite all the buzz, vaping is still a relatively small segment of
tobacco-company sales. For Altria, which has annual sales of $25 billion,
revenue from non-cigarette products including e-cigs will only account for $200
million this year, according to Fleck.

Sales of smokeless tobacco products, primarily chewing tobacco, have been
growing slightly as users look to get their nicotine fix without having to go
outside to light up.

Some 37.3 million U.S. adults still smoke, driving steady revenue outlooks for
the industry. Fleck expects the industry's revenue growth to be in line or
slightly lower than that of the economy. He still expects investors to earn a
nice dividend but doesn't see tobacco firms as big-growth companies going
forward.

The combination of steady revenue and healthy dividends tends to make tobacco
stocks a port in a stormy market. That defensive trait helped drive the tobacco
group to a No. 16 ranking on Friday out of the 197 industry groups tracked by
IBD. Altria sports an IBD Composite Rating of 94, while Reynolds American rates
a 97.

Other brands in the group include Philip Morris International, which was spun
off from Altria in 2008 and focuses on overseas sales, and the U.K.'s British
American Tobacco.

International firms have their own unique set of issues and regulations to deal
with. While smoking is on the downturn in the U.S. and some other developed
countries, tobacco markets have made inroads into developing nations as diverse
as Nigeria, India and China.

On Sept. 29, Japan Tobacco said it was buying the rights to the Natural American
Spirit brand outside the U.S. for $5 billion from Reynolds American.

The Plain-Package Threat

The industry in the U.S. is consolidating. Earlier this year, Reynolds American
got the OK from the Justice Department to buy Lorillard for $25 billion in an
effort to compete with Altria. The top two companies will now control 80% of the
U.S. cigarette market.

To help push the deal along, the companies agreed to sell $7.1 billion in
tobacco brands to the U.K.'s Imperial Tobacco Group.

In addition to consolidation, U.S. regulations help fortify the positions of
Altria and Reynolds as the top players in the U.S. industry.

""Regulation increases the barriers of entry in the industry and reinforces the
competitive advantage""of companies that are already established, Fleck said.

Most current smokers already have a favorite brand, and with tobacco ads banned
on television and in other forms of media, it's harder for an upstart company to
gain market share.

But government regulation is a double-edged sword for tobacco companies. Brand
loyalty could become less relevant if the U.S. were to adopt plain packaging
like Australia did in 2012. The U.K. plans to implement in May a law similar to
Australia's, requiring the removal of all branding from cigarette packs. Instead
of cool logos, the packs will feature large warnings and gruesome pictures of
diseased lungs and premature babies. U.K. tobacconists are appealing
parliament's decision.

""The big concern is that consumers are going to say ""Forget it, if people aren't
going to see me smoking Marlboros or Camels then I'm going with a cheaper
brand,' "" Fleck said.

Decreasing Legal Problems?

State-level and class-action lawsuits against tobacco firms reached a peak in
the '90 s and early '00 s. Morningstar says legal issues are less of a risk
going forward.

Earlier this year, Altria, Reynolds and Lorillard agreed to pay $100 million in
total to settle 400 lawsuits in Florida. But the number is down from the $500
million the tobacco industry paid out in cases across the state over the past 10
years. There are still over 3,000 unresolved cases in Florida's court system.

Fleck sees taxes as more of a risk to tobacco firms than lawsuits from smokers.
The federal government has to find ways to balance revenue from taxes and its
campaign to keep people from smoking.

In 2009, President Obama signed a bill to raise taxes on cigarettes. Tobacco
firms passed on the price increase, boosting prices 22% overnight. That, in
turn, deepened the decline in smokers -- in 2010, 3 million fewer people smoked
vs. in 2009, according to the CDC.

Pro-Con: Should Port Lavaca ban smoking, vaping indoors?

BYLINE: Sara Sneath, Victoria Advocate, Texas

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

Aug. 17--PORT LAVACA -- A city ordinance banning smoking and vaping in public
buildings has gathered opposition from business owners.

The ordinance went into effect in April, but opponents collected signatures of
204 registered voters to bring the issue back to council. The ban was lifted
Aug. 10 and will appear on the ballot in November.

Business owners said they have the right to decide whether to allow smoking in
their establishments. They fear the ban could be bad for business.

Supporters of the ban said it's a public health issue. Exposure to secondhand
smoke can cause disease and premature death, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

PRO: Smoking threatens public health

Even a limited exposure to secondhand smoke puts a person at risk for heart
disease, said Calhoun County public health director Lisa Campbell.

""Smoke-free ordinances save lives, and they're proven to save lives,"" she said.

Public policy is a tool used to improve the health of a community, she said.
Campbell served as the spokeswoman for the Smoke-Free Victoria Coalition, which
worked to pass a smoking ban ordinance in Victoria.

Victoria residents overwhelmingly voted in favor of the ordinance in 2006.

""Public health policy saves lives. Look at seatbelt laws,"" she said. ""Smoking
ordinances do the same thing.""

Business owners in Victoria also were concerned about how a ban on smoking in
public buildings would affect their bottom lines, said Victoria City Councilman
Tom Halepaska. But almost 10 years later, the ban doesn't appear to have made a
difference in patronage.

""None of them went out of business that I know of,"" he said.

Campbell said she doesn't buy the bad-for-business argument.

With a smoke ban in place, some people might be more willing to go out if they
know they won't have to smell smoke or have it affect their health, she said.

Businesses also should take into consideration the costs of health insurance,
she said.

By implementing a smoking ban, employers are creating a healthier environment
for their employees, cutting down on the the amount of days off for hospital
visits and reducing doctor bills, she said.

Alicia Danielle Jordan, of Port Lavaca, said she can't stand the smell in
smoking establishments.

""I go out smelling like smoke, and I'm not even doing it,"" she said.

Jordan plans to vote in favor of the ban, which would also restrict the use of
electronic cigarettes.

But for Campbell, it's all about community health.

""Those policies save lives, and that should really be the primary concern of
local government,"" she said. ""Saving lives and improving the health of their
local citizens.""

CON: Bans infringe on rights of business owners

Smoking is an otherwise legal activity and business owners should not be forced
to ban it in their establishments, said James Prince, of Port Lavaca.

If business owners are losing customers because of their smoking policy, they
can change it.

""Each business owner has the right to allow or disallow smoking in their
establishment. If I do not like their policies, I do not have to patronize their
establishment,"" Prince said. ""Let the market decide this issue.""

Owners and employees of Port Lavaca bars came to a council meeting to voice
their concerns about the smoking ban.

The owner of The Other Office bar, Christine Henze Demeio, said her business
suffered during the three months the city's smoking ban was in place.

As a nonsmoker, Demeio wouldn't care about the ordinance if her business wasn't
at risk, she said.

""It has killed my business,"" she said. ""My day business went down at least a
third.""

Henze Demeio said most of the 204 registered voters who signed the petition to
bring the smoking ban ordinance back to City Council were nonsmokers. But they,
too, thought the decision should be up to business owners.

But Councilman Jerry Smith noted that 204 people only accounts for about 3.3
percent of registered voters in the city.

The ban will be on the Nov. 3 ballot.

""I pay rent to a council member,"" Demeio said. ""But what gives him the right to
take away my business?""

Experts say employers need to establish rules on e-cigarettes

Oct. 25--POTTSVILLE -- As the vaping community grows, businesses should have a
policy for e-cigarette use in the workplace, experts say.

E-cigarettes have become popular as a way to quit smoking. But there is now a
question whether people who vape in the workplace should get a designated area
like smokers or whether vaping should be allowed at all, said attorney Holly
Cline, a partner in the Buchanan, Ingersoll and Rooney firm in Harrisburg,
during a recent seminar held by the Northeast Pennsylvania Manufacturers and
Employers Association.

Of particular concern is that a person vaping could be using marijuana and
getting high on the job.

Cline said every company should develop a policy in order to avoid problems that
may develop down the road.

""You have to be as clear and specific as possible, and let the employees know so
there is no potential down the road for argument,"" she said. ""When you put your
policy in place, make it as comprehensive as possible. A safer approach is to
take them into the same consideration as cigarettes. You can simply amend your
policy to make cigarettes extend to e-cigarettes.""

The devices come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have only been on the
American market for less than a decade. The product remains unregulated at the
federal level, though there are some state and local laws. Some cities have
banned their use in public places. There is an age restriction -- a person has
to be 18 to purchase one.

The vapor can worsen indoor air quality and potentially cause eye irritation,
respiratory problems, nausea and headaches.

Cline said the other dangers they pose are much worse than smoking. Cannabis oil
and other things can be put in them and it's possible an employer might not know
what their employees are vaping.

""It makes monitoring drug abuse in the workplace difficult,"" she said. ""More
often than not, you are seeing big employers banning it. The list includes CVS,
Wal-Mart, UPS, Target, Home Depot and Starbucks.""

While hashish oil is not available in a store that sells e-cigarettes, it can be
obtained on the open market by anyone, said Shohn Montano, a volunteer
firefighter employed by Berwick Offray who became familiar with vaping in a
previous employment situation. Hashish oil can also be manufactured with
household chemicals.

Because the liquid is burned at such a high temperature to create the vapor,
Montano said it has the potential to be dangerous in any workplace where
hazardous or flammable materials are present.

""I actually saw a person who was doing it who had second- and third-degree burns
because they were doing it inside a car,"" he said.

The vape dilemma

BYLINE: Arman Ahmad

SECTION: Sunday spotlight; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 1135 words","


Health experts are warning of the dangers of vape smoking. ARMAN AHMAD speaks to
them, as well as consumer groups, to find out the risk of this trending habit.

TO vape or not to vape? That seems to be the question on everybody's mind since
Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam called for Malaysians to stop the
habit for two months.

This is to give the Health Ministry time to find answers, from agencies and
related parties, on its effect on people's health.

Dr Subramaniam's statement was followed by a flurry of responses from health
experts.

On Thursday, heart and lung specialist from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia
Medical Centre, Dr Khairulfaizi Haron was reported as saying that propylene
glycol and nicotine could cause people to suffer from dry skin, asthma, stroke,
as well as heart disease.

On Friday, Dr Dalilah Kamaruddin, chief medical officer of the National Cancer
Society's, Cancer Screening Centre, said uid nicotine inhale from an elec tronic
cigarette, had the same properties as nitric acid, a known chemical catalyst in
the occurrence of cancer in the human body.

But are vapes reall dangerous? Shou Malaysians immediately stop using them?

Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Dr Ashok Zachariah Philip said
that while he was not aware of any studies that had been published, or was about
to be published, on the dangers of e-cigarettes in Malaysia, the MMA would
prefer to see the authorities err on the side of caution.

""I am not aware of any local studies published yet. Many studies worldwide show
vaping is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, but not without harmful
effects. The long-term health effects, if any, will only become evident after
epidemiological studies compare vaping with non-vaping groups. At present, we do
not know. Most toxicity of cigarettes and e-cigarettes is not due to nicotine,
so just using nicotine-free liquids does not mean there is no toxicity.

""However, dependence is mainly due to nicotine. The Health Ministry is trying to
restrict vaping because of the strong likelihood that drawing chemical vapour
into the lungs for years is going to cause damage,"" he said.

Most e-cigarette users use liquids that contain nicotine and often some
flavouring, he added.

""The vapour produced has fewer toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke, but the
nicotine remains,"" Dr Ashok told the New Sunday Times.

He added that because there were fewer toxins, e-cigarettes might be useful for
smokers who wish to reduce the harmful effects of cigarette smoke or who want to
try and reduce, or quit smoking.

""However, because of the nicotine, there is strong potential for addiction.
Thus, it is desirable that the marketing, advertising and sale of e-cigarettes
be regulated in a similar fashion to tobacco, to prevent young non-smokers from
taking it up as a more socially acceptable alternative to cigarettes. As to
whether it is more addictive than tobacco, I believe further studies are
needed,"" he said.

Dr Ashok also said pregnant women should be cautious of using e-cigarettes, as
there was no evidence that it was any safer in pregnancy, than tobacco.

""Studies are needed on the effects of second-hand exposure to e-cigarette smoke.
Though there are fewer toxins, and thus probably fewer deleterious effects, it
is likely there will be some harm if exposure is heavy and prolonged.

""Finally, it should be noted that many other substances, including narcotics,
can be vaped, so there is a potential for (drug) addiction as well.""

The MMA would like to see the authorities err on the side of caution and take
measures to prevent young people from taking up the e-cigarette habit, Dr Ashok
added.

As to the chemicals in e-cigarettes, there were known carcinogens in the fumes,
but in reduced numbers and concentrations than in cigarettes.

Thus, the effect was likely to be less severe than normal cigarettes, and
comprehensive studies must be conducted to observe and document any ill-effects.
Whether any chemical causes harm (for example propylene glycol), depended on the
concentration and total amount inhaled, he said.

A doctor, who wished to remain anonymous, said no one knew the actual long-term
effects of vaping.

""We don't know the longterm effects of this problem. It may manifest in 10 or 20
years,"" he said.

He said this was worrisome because more younger people were picking up the habit
despite efforts by the government and doctors.

""Many younger people are picking up on this new trend,"" he added.

Vaping was also a cost effective alternative to smoking cigarettes, which are
now expensive.

But he cautioned that if it continued to be unregulated, it could become
dangerous.

""What they will try to do, is find the cheaper alternative. The businesses
respond to making cheaper alternatives by adding more and more chemicals and
additives.

""We really don't know what they are putting in the e-liquids (most are imported
from China). Nobody is regulating it. Anything you are taking into your body
will definitely have side effects,"" he said.

Headded that like cigarettes, vape users would eventually get younger and
younger.

""What is even worse is that there seems to be more girls vaping as well,"" he
said.

Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) secretary-general Datuk
Paul Selvaraj said the government should move strongly towards educating people
to stop all forms of smoking.

""They are essentially variations of the same thing. Anything that is a health
risk should be eliminated. The target should be education and awareness.

""If there is a clear link (to negative health effects), then action should be
taken,"" he said.

He added that vaping was a cheap and affordable way for people to circumvent
smoking.

""Some people say that it is better than smoking, but we shouldn't look at the
degrees. We should work towards eliminating,"" he said.

However, there were others who said the government should study the issue
further before making any decision.

Muslim Consumers Association of Malaysia (PPIM) chief activist Datuk Nadzim
Johan said the Health Ministry should conduct the research or try to refer to
findings from those with the experience.

""As I said earlier, we are not experts in the field, so we should get the
authority on research for findings on vaping.

""There are many things that can become cancer agents. For us to jump to
(conclusions) is not a clever (move).""

He said the relevant parties needed to find out if this was a real problem or
just an opinion.

""Don't shoot from the hip. We should conduct research and talk with facts and
figures,"" he said.

He added that there was a big lobby by cigarette companies who have ""all the
money in the world"".

""The research must come from someone reputable, not from somebody who has a
vested interest.

""After all, cigarettes themselves cause cancer. Which is the greater evil?"" he
asked.

Could e-cigarettes rekindle battle over public smoking?

SECTION: B; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 842 words","


It was trivia night, and Michael Jamnick didn't want to leave the TGI Friday's
in Maple Grove, Minn., to go outside and have a smoke. So he started puffing
right where he sat.

The 27-year-old wasn't breaking the law: He was using an electronic cigarette.

Still, Jamnick said he felt uncomfortable vaping (the e-cigarette term for
lighting up).

""It's been, what, six years now since they passed the smoking ban (here)"" he
said. ""You give it a funny look because you haven't seen it in a while.""

The e-cigarette industry is promoting vaping as a hip, healthier alternative to
smoking - and as a way to quit. But while health experts largely agree that the
vapour from e-cigarettes poses less of a threat to public health than tobacco
cigarettes, some worry that welcoming the so-called ""clean nicotine"" could erode
smoking bans, encourage smokers to trade one addiction for another and hook
nonsmokers.

""Shifting entirely over to vaping from smoking would be a big public-health
plus,"" said Robert Proctor, a history-of-science professor at Stanford
University. ""But the question of whether e-cigarettes are good or bad isn't that
simple.""

E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that create a vapour mist from a heated
liquid solution when the user inhales on a mouthpiece. The solution, or
""e-juice,"" and vapour mist, which looks like smoke, typically contain nicotine,
but users can regulate the amount. That's why some vapers say e-cigarettes have
helped them quit tobacco and wean themselves off nicotine altogether.

Research released in late June by Italy's University of Catania lends support to
those claims. The study found that 13 per cent of participants who used
high-dose e-cigarettes quit smoking. Seventy per cent of those who quit smoking
eventually gave up e-cigarettes, too.

""As evidenced in this study, when people switch to electronic cigarettes, it
absolutely makes it easier to quit nicotine use completely,"" said Michael
Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health who studies
e-cigarettes. ""It's not as simple as saying people are substituting one
addiction for another.""

In fact, Siegel said, the quit rate for e-cigarettes is comparable to rates in
other nicotine replacement therapy studies.

But others maintain that it's not yet known how harmful vaping could be.

""We frankly don't know much about them,"" said Robert Moffitt, an American Lung
Association media-relations director.

Concerns about harm from secondhand vapour are not at the forefront. While a
2012 German study found that the vapour is an ""aerosol of ultrafine particles,""
no studies have shown it to be dangerous. But Moffitt and others question claims
that e-cigarettes can help smokers quit.

""We'd strongly recommend (against anyone) using them,"" he said, ""especially with
so many other valid smoking-cessation devices and techniques that we know work.""

He also doubts that the e-cigarette industry, which includes big tobacco
companies, would encourage people to stop using nicotine entirely. ""They're
looking for new young people to get hooked on nicotine products,"" he said, ""and
e-cigarettes seem to be the latest.""

Stanford's Proctor, however, sees both the promise and the threat in the recent
rapid spread of e-cigarettes.

""E-cigs seem to offer us the possibility of keeping the addiction while losing
the cancer,"" he said. ""But is addiction itself a bad thing? That question is
splitting the public-health community, and it's not yet clear which direction
we'll go.""

Michael ""Troop"" Wolberg, 41, used to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day. After
trying to quit several times, he turned to e-cigarettes. On his third day of
vaping, the Stacy, Minn., man says he lit his last cigarette. Since then, he's
become a champion of e-cigarettes. He's written online reviews of vaping
products, become a member of the Minnesota Vapers Club and helps run an online
business that sells flavoured e-juice.

Wolberg, who calls himself an advocate of ""tobacco harm reduction,"" isn't shy
about using his e-cigarette. ""I'm rather proud to display it in public because I
think it needs to be seen,"" he said.

Cynthia Hallett couldn't disagree more. Hallett, executive director of Americans
for Nonsmokers' Rights, says vaping could undermine the hard-won battles to
establish nonsmoking areas.

Proctor echoes her concerns. ""If you can't tell whether someone is vaping or
smoking, that could work to erode established no-smoking zones,"" he said.

So far, e-cigarettes aren't widely regulated, but they have been banned in many
K-12 schools, and some colleges and universities also have moved to ban them.

The Lung Association's Moffitt hopes legal measures will be taken to ban
e-cigarettes in public places before they become more common.

""Maybe we need to put the kibosh on these right now,"" he said.

For now, using e-cigarettes may come down to common courtesy.

Jamnick, who has quit smoking cigarettes, doubts he'll use his e-cigarette much
anymore when he's out.

""Generally, I try to avoid using it around other people,"" he said, ""because some
people just don't like it.""

KURE - Taps NoDa in Charlotte, N.C. for its 2nd Vaporium & Lounge

LENGTH: 508  words","

DATELINE: Denver


UBM Marketing and Communications Services has issued the following Press
release:

KURE Corp. (""KURE"") announced today the official Grand Opening date of Saturday,
March 7th for its second KURE Vaporium & Lounge location in the NoDa district of
Charlotte, North Carolina. This marks the second location to open this year, the
first being in December in Gastonia, North Carolina. KURE presents a custom
designed retail store and lounge that creates a welcoming and unique experience
for its customers.

""We wanted a feel that was modern, cool, but most importantly inviting. We set
out to build something that would set us apart from all other vape shops in the
country and introduce the art of vaping to a broader audience. Every aspect of
KURE, beginning with our store design that includes 360° custom glass towers to
display our large selection of premium e-cigarette and vaping products was
designed to give our customers a distinctive ""vaporium"" atmosphere. KURE's focal
point is its large custom e-juice mixing and tasting bar where customers can
sample, customize and purchase Kure ""Juice On Tap"", ultra-premium, USA made
e-liquids. We also built a massive ""Wall of Juice"" to showcase other premium
branded juices. We knew it was crucial to our divergence from the typical ""vape
shop"" to also provide a spacious and inviting lounge for customers to enjoy and
share vaping with others. Every KURE Vaporium & Lounge features a specialty
coffee and snack bar, numerous customer plug-in areas and really comfortable
lounge chairs. No other retailer of vaping products offers such a unique
experience for its customers. KURE is also proud to state that our furniture was
custom built in North Carolina, home of our corporate headquarters,"" comments
Stephanie Staffieri, Chief Marketing Officer for KURE.

KURE currently has three other stores in various stages of construction in the
Charlotte area and one in Boca Raton, FL. The Boca Raton store is scheduled to
open later this month, and the other Charlotte area stores are scheduled for
completion sometime this spring.  Each location will boast the same attention to
detail in design and customer experience. KURE and its financial partner Siskey
Capital, LLC plan to aggressively expand the presence of its KURE Vaporium &
Lounges throughout the U.S. within the next 24 months.

""After the tremendous success of our Gastonia store opening, we are thrilled to
be coming to NoDa in Charlotte. When the overwhelming feedback from customers is
'WOW, this is unlike anything we've seen,' it's confirmation that our vision of
a premium vaping experience is what like-minded enthusiasts want,"" says David
Peterson, CEO of KURE. ""We are also very pleased with the numbers coming from
Gastonia for the past 60 days and from NoDa these past two weeks. Both stores
have exceeded our expectations and are seeing a significant development of
customer loyalty and impressive sales growth each week.""

Baltimore Sun: City Council poised to limit 'vaping'

LENGTH: 161  words","

DATELINE: College Park


University System of Maryland has issued the following news release:

In a Baltimore Sun article about the Baltimore City Council's impending decision
on whether to limit electronic cigarette 'vaping,' SPH's Dr. Pamela Clark
explained that there is reason to be cautious about the growing popularity of
alternatives to traditional tobacco cigarettes.

Though vaping is likely less harmful than smoking, she said, there is still much
we don't know about its health effects.

""Since everything else is up in the air, the only thing we can recommend is
treat them like regular cigarettes,"" Dr. Clark told The Sun.

Dr. Clark,  research professor in the Department of Behavioral and Community
Health, was recently chosen as one of the Baltimore Sun's ""50 Women to Watch""
for her prominent research into e-cigarettes and other tobacco alternatives to
smoking.

'Vaping' loyalists want acceptance;
Concerns exist that e-cigarettes could lead to the tobacco variety

BYLINE: Joseph Hall, News services

Natalia Jakobowska has not tried any of the cheesecake varieties yet.

""But I'd love to,"" says the 29-year-old nurse, who has settled so far on plain
old vanilla as her flavour of choice.

There are dozens and dozens of other taste options she could pick from in the
connoisseur market that is emerging around electronic cigarette smoking in
Canada.

But ah, that word - smoking! It's verboten among the tens of thousands of people
in this country who have taken up the tobacco alternative in recent years.

""We're vapers,"" Kate Ackerman says emphatically.

""Cigarettes produce smoke. So that's smoking. Electronic cigarettes produce
vapour. So that's vaping,"" says Ackerman, a director of the Electronic Cigarette
Trade Association of Canada.

The vapour electronic cigarettes produce is all but odourless and, many argue,
far, far safer than tobacco smoke for users and anyone within second-hand range.

While odourless, however, so called e-cigarettes are producing the stench of
controversy as their popularity rises.

This mostly revolves around regulatory questions about their actual safety and
where they can be used. There is also concern among many that electronic
cigarettes could be a gateway to the tobacco variety.

Jakobowska has vaped in shopping malls, on smoking-restricted patios and at the
Cambridge cosmetic clinic where she works, all without a whisper of complaint,
she says.

""No one has ever said anything,"" says the longtime smoker, who hasn't had a puff
of tobacco since she took up e-cigarettes last year.

Just last month, however, complaints were launched about a passenger vaping on
an Air Canada flight from Calgary to Toronto, the CBC reported. Air Canada
forbids inflight vaping.

In several jurisdictions, both here and in the United States, there are now
concerted attempts to shrink vaping spaces to the dismal, butt-strewn plots
allotted smokers.

""But smoking legislation was created because smoke has been proven to be
dangerous,"" says Ackerman, who runs her own e-cigarette company outside Calgary.
""It's dangerous to the bystander, it's unpleasant, it stinks. It's a bad thing.""

Lacking evidence to show second-hand health impacts - and any offensive smell -
electronic cigarettes have largely escaped indoor bans.

But that's left a free-for-all in terms of allowable vaping space, with
businesses and institutions largely left to classify their premises as they see
fit.

No one knows quite how many vapers there are across the country right now. Last
month Health Canada said it would commission a $230,000 study on the number of
e-cigarettes sold here over the past two years.

The flavourings are among e-cigarettes' key selling points says Ackerman, with
everything from cherry cheesecake and blueberry pie to tobacco, liquor and wine
tastes being infused into the products.

And as with cigar or wine aficionados, Ackerman says a burgeoning vaping
culture, ""an incredibly huge social network,"" has gown up around the devices.

But electronic cigarettes' main selling point, says Ackerman, is the presumed
health improvements over burned tobacco products.

""The main thing is this is an alternative to smoking cigarettes, it's a harm
reduction product,"" she says.

The e-cigarettes utilize small heating elements to vaporize a propylene glycol
liquid. It's the same stuff that produces fog at rock concerts.

""It's also what's used in asthma inhalers, it's used in hospitals to purify the
air,"" says Ackerman, who smoked for decades before turning to e-cigarettes.

While propylene glycol is a known irritant, Ackerman says, it has none of the
carcinogenetic or artery-hardening properties that tobacco smoke carries.

In many countries outside of Canada, however, the propylene glycol fuel is also
infused with nicotine. Though it's the addictive agent in cigarettes, nicotine
itself is not a carcinogen and is classified most often as a stimulant in the
same vein as caffeine.

But citing nicotine's addictiveness - and a lack of evidence that
smoking-cessation benefits outweigh potential risks - Health Canada has refused
to approve the sale or import of devices or liquid refills containing nicotine.

That hasn't stopped many - likely the majority - of Canadian vapers from buying
the nicotine juice online.

Yet even with a nicotine additive, electronic cigarettes remain far safer than
their tobacco alternatives, many experts say.

Dr. Gopal Bhatnagar, a cardiac surgeon at Mississauga's Trillium Health Centre,
is so certain of their health benefits that he founded the e-cigarette company
180 Smoke to help people quit the tobacco version.

""Tobacco smokers, people who take combustibles, they want the nicotine, it's the
tobacco byproducts that kill them,"" the former Trillium chief of staff says.
""Tobacco has over 6,000 carcinogens in it ... stuff that also stiffens arteries,
which leads to cardiovascular disease as well.""

Importantly, Bhatnagar says, vaping can calm the powerful psychological cravings
for cigarettes - whether it's delivering nicotine or not. He says traditional
nicotine replacement products - like gum and patches - wean only a quarter of
smokers who try them off of cigarettes.

""People want the oral and manual sensation of a cigarette ... they want to put
something in their mouth, they want to hold something,"" Bhatnagar says. ""I do
feel the electronic cigarette, it provides that.""

That was nurse Jakobowska's experience when she was quitting tobacco.

""It helped psychologically,"" she says. ""When you're talking on the phone, when
you go outside, have a drink, when you're driving, it's helpful in those
situations.""

One of the key e-cigarette critiques, however, has been that the nicotine-laced
varieties could be gateways to tobacco smoking for young people.

But Bhatnagar says vaper demographics would argue strongly against this, with
the vast majority of e-cigarette users being former smokers, or people trying to
quit. While he cites U.S. Food and Drug Administration studies showing
e-cigarettes produce exceedingly low levels of toxins, Bhatnagar admits there is
no conclusive evidence that vaping is an effective smoking cessation therapy.

""But if you're asking me as a physician in terms of tobacco harm reduction, I
strongly believe from a public health policy point of view that electronic
cigarettes (could be) a very significant answer.""

He has the backing of Dr. Peter Selby, one of Canada's leading tobacco experts.
Selby, the head of addictions at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental
Health, says e-cigarettes have the potential to be a winning weapon in the long
battle against tobacco.

""If this is part of a bigger plan to figure out a way to get rid of combustible
cigarettes and ban them, then it's a fantastic opportunity,"" says Selby. ""It
will be revolutionary, similar to when we decided to get rid of leaded
gasoline.""

Should Canada find the will to ban tobacco products, e-cigarettes would provide
a safe, cheap and acceptable replacement for those who would otherwise smoke,
Selby says.

As it stands now, however, Health Canada is blocking their widespread use as
nicotine alternatives by insisting that they be approved under the agency's
medical device category.

""If this comes in as a medicine it will kill it and it will keep combustible
cigarettes on the market,"" Selby says. ""We've seen that with other nicotine
replacements. It's never been able to replace cigarettes.""

Instead, Selby says, regulations should ensure that the percentage of people who
need or will turn to nicotine have the safest delivery product available. He
says the federal health agency is likely having trouble classifying e-cigarettes
because they are neither tobacco nor medicines.

""The way I look at it, they have a round hole and a square hole, and this is a
triangle,"" he says. ""And they are trying to stuff it into one of those two holes
and both are wrong. They need to create a triangle.""

This ban on vaping will make an ass of the law

BYLINE: Robbie Dinwoodie

SECTION: Pg. 15

LENGTH: 698 words","


NO-ONE was more grateful than this writer when the ban on smoking in public
places came in. The fact that there was ever some imaginary ""debate"" on whether
or not passive smoking was harmful was down to the intransigence of Big Tobacco
and their slippery lawyers.

Several times between my late teens and into my thirties I was ""rushed"", as
journalists are wont to put it, to the casualty department as my asthma became
critical.

Anyone who hasn't had, fully conscious, the big syringe of adrenalin straight
into a vein on the back of the hand hasn't lived, or rather, hasn't nearly died.

The cause was always a smoky atmosphere, whether in a pub or at a party.

Indeed, my early journalistic days were spent in a newsroom where communication
was through a fug of blue smoke which included pipes and cigars.

In my later years better control of asthma meant fewer crises, but the
discomfort continued in pubs and parties.

Even bus stops, for goodness sake.

When pubs were made smoke free in 2006 the effect on many of us was liberating.

A night out no longer meant nipping out for a puff of a blue inhaler.

So why am I so uneasy about the proposal by the Welsh Government to treat
e-cigarettes in exactly the same way as tobacco?

For reasons of both practicality and principle. Smoking kills.

No-one doubts that anymore except the cartel and its lawyers fighting old legal
battles.

Passive smoking is harmful. That, surely, is no longer in doubt.

So we are edging towards a defensible and comprehensive philosophical position
where well-informed adults are permitted to engage in behaviour which may be
harmful to themselves.

Of course, this is provided they know the risks and provided they do not harm
others.

Where on earth does banning vaping fit into this?

Treating the use of e-cigarettes in the same way you treat actual cigarettes is
about as stupid a public health position as you could ever reach.

The key facts are: smoking is shockingly bad for you, and quite bad for those
around you; vaping is less bad for you, and harmless to those around you.

If, as the evidence suggests, vaping is helping people get off actual fags why
not support them? Smokers, who feel themselves a beleaguered group, resent
having to smoke outside licensed establishments.

But many of us resent having to pass through a cloud of smoke at the door, while
feeling no great discomfort from those vaping.

My own politics are part social democrat, part libertarian, and the question is
always, why is this law necessary?

For me the key is third-party harm. Folk should have the right, if they have
been given all the facts, to go to hell in their own way.

But no-one should have the right to hurt anyone else along the way.

That is why the ban on smoking in public places was the right decision to make.

It is also, in my view, why the ban on smoking in cars with children present
accords with the principle of no harm to third parties.

And in the same way, it is why we have to agree that limits on the drink-drive
limit are necessary.

Again, it is about third-party harm, about ways of saying to wider society that
harming fellow citizens is wrong.

It is also why the some recent moves by Police Scotland have worried me. Before
this centralisation Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh had their different ways of
dealing with prostitution.

Now we have the Glasgow way for the whole country. But Holyrood didn't pass any
new laws. How did this happen?

A shop in Aberdeen is raided and shut down for selling legal highs as part of a
new crackdown by Police Scotland. I carry no candle for these substances but I
would have thought the key word was legal.

I don't get to vote for who is chief constable, and I struggle to understand why
he is in effect changing our laws, and why our MSPs are letting him do this.

Our tribunes need to work out what laws can achieve, which ones they should
pass, and what swathes of our lives they should avoid meddling in.

Anything that involves potential harm to third parties should be subject to the
rule of law.

Anything else should be a matter for health education, which should inform
citizens of risks and then leave them to work out their own route to salvation,
or to hell in a handcart.

KUALA LUMPUR: The Health Ministry may soon include vaping in its ban on smoking
in public places.

Describing the trend as dangerous, Deputy Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi
Yahaya, quoted an international study that propylene glycol a chemical additive
used to produce the vapour has been proven to turn into formaldehyde.

The substance was also found to be carcinogenic or can cause cancer "" he said,
adding that the ministry would conduct a study to get a clearer picture and
review the findings soon.

""Please stay away from vaping and even shisha for now,"" he told the New Sunday
Times, yesterday.

Health authorities have also reportedly told shisha smokers to abstain from it
until the effects could be determined.

Every year, 20,000 Malaysians die from smoking-related illnesses. It was further
reported that an estimated 4.7 million Malaysians smoke, 38 per cent of them are
men and one per cent women.

On July 30, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam said effective Jan 1,
all public spaces except for open parking areas would be gazetted as non-smoking
areas.

The ministry had also decided that smoking would be banned from air conditioned
restaurants and that it would begin enforcing the ban next year.

E-cigarette vapour has NO toxic effect and is as safe as AIR, shock study
claims;
Tobacco giant uses smoking robot and human lung cells to test the health risks
of 'vaping' - with astonishing results

BYLINE: By Jasper Hamill

SECTION: NEWS,TECHNOLOGY & SCIENCE,TECHNOLOGY

Electronic cigarettes pump out vapour which has NO toxic effect on the cells
found in human lungs, scientists have claimed.

Fresh research funded by British American Tobacco has suggested inhaling
nicotine vapour could be as safe as breathing air.

To perform its experiments, the tobacco giant teamed up with the MatTek
Corporation, which makes models of human cells used in 'in vitro' laboratory
experiments.

Scientists then used a ""smoking robot"" to expose these lung cell replicas to
tobacco smoke, the vapour from two different brands of e-cig and just plain old
air.

When exposed to old-fashioned smoke for six hours, the cells died.

But after subjecting the cells to an ""aggressive and continuous"" dose of vapour,
researchers claimed the damage to the airway tissue was ""similar to that of
air"".

'By employing a combination of a smoking robot and a lab-based test using
respiratory tissue, it was possible to demonstrate.... the e-cigarette aerosols
used in this study have no [toxic] effect on human airway tissue,' said BAT
spokesperson Dr Marina Murphy.

There are now plans to carry out the same tests using the vapour from a wider
variety of e-cigs, to prove its results.

""Currently there are no standards concerning the in vitro testing of e-cigarette
aerosols,"" said Marina Trani, Group Head Scientific Product Stewardship at
British American Tobacco.

""Our protocol could prove very useful in helping the process by which these
guidelines might progress.""

A debate about the safety of e-cigarettes has now been raging for several years.

Study after study have highlighted health risks, although most experts agree
vaping is much safer than smoking cigarettes.

Dr Michael Siegel, professor in the department of community health sciences at
Boston University's school of public health, welcomed the latest study as
evidence of the safety of electronic cigarettes.

""Despite the limitations of the research, it adds additional evidence to support
the contention that vaping is a lot safer than smoking,"" he said.

He called on public health bodies and anti-tobacco groups to encourage smokers
to swap to vaping - a step which would ""transform the nicotine market and
achieve a huge public health victory"".

""Such a phenomenon would result in the greatest public health miracle of our
lifetimes,"" Dr Siegel proclaimed.

However, the health expert warned that overheating liquid nicotine could produce
dangerous toxins.

Vaping advocates previously claimed the results of research which found e-cigs
pumped out dangerous chemicals were false because the nicotine liquid had been
exposed to high temperatures.

Earlier this year, British American Tobacco announced the release of a device
called Voke which is licensed as a medicine and produces no heat, working more
like an asthma inhaler than an electronic cigarette.

Tom Pruen, chief scientific officer of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade
Association, told Mirror Online he was satisfied the latest research was
accurate.

""While I'm sure that for many the source of the research will be a problem, of
recent years the science conducted by the tobacco industry has been of very good
quality, and despite the historic issues I wouldn't view it with any greater
scepticism than research conducted elsewhere,"" he said.

""The results are not unexpected.

""Not only are the components of an e-cig aerosol expected to be of low toxicity,
based on a large number of analytical studies, but this research broadly agrees
with a previous study.""

Health Canada needs to consider benefits of electronic cigarettes

Health Canada needs to examine how electronic cigarettes could benefit those
trying to quit smoking.

Cobourg resident Nancy Hendsbee tried anything and everything to quit smoking.
She has smoked for 34 years until she discovered e-cigarettes, and says vaping
helped her overcome her cigarette addiction.

The ability to vape with nicotine has helped, she says, and Ms. Hendsbee has now
been tobacco free for two months. She began to sleep better after three days and
is no longer passing on second-hand smoke.

Although e-cigarettes have been around for about 10 years in some parts of the
world, Health Canada has not yet been able to determine potential risks to using
the product. It has not approved any e-cigarette with nicotine for sale;
officials say there is not yet enough scientific evidence to verify the
potential benefits of e-cigarettes in helping Canadians quit smoking.

Provincial legislation will be adding more restrictions to the sale and use of
electronic cigarettes. The ban on the sale of electronic cigarettes to youth
under 19 years old is sensible, but restricting the display and promotion of the
e-cigarettes, when so little of the health risks have been defined and so many
adults have reported success with them in quitting tobacco, is overreaching.

Local vaping business owner Mark Gallagher was also able to quit smoking after
30 years. He readily admits vaping is not a recognized smoking cessation system.
However he does note the vast majority of consumers have experienced success in
getting off cigarettes.

Since much anecdotal evidence suggests vaping helps smokers quit tobacco, its
potential as a recognized smoking cessation tool is something Health Canada
needs to jump on sooner rather than later.

Citing a lack of scientific evidence, Health Canada continues to advise
Canadians against the use of the products, cautioning consumers that electronic
cigarettes may pose health risks, although they do not spell out any risks.

According to Mr. Gallagher there have been truly independent non-partisan tests
posted publicly by scientists. The results have stated clearly that vaping is 95
to 99 times safer than a tobacco product.

Canadians need to know if this is a viable option to quit smoking. The benefits
to not only smokers but those who risk inhaling second-hand tobacco smoke on a
daily basis is on the line. A smoke-free Canada would definitely be a healthier
Canada.

Trends English toffee, elderflower, Pink Lady apple - these boys' e-cig flavours
are taking vaping upmarket says Susannah Butter

CHRISTIAN Sanderson works in fashion. His neat beard and sartorial sense mark
him out as a man of up-tothe-minute taste. So when his girlfriend, Vogue fashion
features editor Laura Weir, saw him reach for an electronic cigarette he says
that she was taken aback. ""When I first vaped my girlfriend said, 'That looks
ridiculous, what are you doing?'"" That was a year ago. Sanderson, a smoker for
17 years, had resolved to give up after a particularly wheezy cycling holiday in
the Alps. ""I tried every form of nicotine substitute then I was introduced to
vapouriser pens. They made a dramatic difference but there wasn't anything for
the older, more style-conscious demographic who want to be able to vape on the
Tube without being embarrassed,"" says the 31-year-old, puffing on a discreet
black machine. ""The market was saturated with complicated brands and flavours,
so you didn't know what you were vaping.""

He had the idea for an alternative at 4am and called his childhood friend
Michael Thompson, who works in the City, about it at six. They recruited another
pal, Mario Yalias, who has a tech background, and formed Simple Vape Co, working
around their day jobs. It's going well so far. Last month they went to represent
the company at Parliament, where e cigarette legislation is being discussed as
an attempt to clear the confusion about what this technology represents.

Vaping is already allowed at the House of Commons bar and Nick Clegg is the
latest high-profile ""vapist"" (the Simple Vape Co boys claim not to have heard
the term or be aware of the derogatory connotations when it is used by smokers).

Much like a teenager encouraging his friend to try their first fag, Yalias is
keen for me to have a vape. They have brought their range along to the King's
Head members' club in Haggerston, near their office. The packaging is all clean
lines and neutral colours - suggesting that an expensive scented candle might be
inside.

Instead there are four delicate bottles of e-liquids, one for each flavour -
English toffee and banana, elderflower and pear, Pink Lady apple and French
tobacco.

They start me on elderflower, which I protest is a girly stereotype but they
tell me is a bestseller. I don't smoke and never thought I would vape, so
Continued on Page 42 Continued from Page 41 they adjust the vapouriser so that
the nicotine dosage will be low - 3mg.

The mixture is made in a laboratory in Hampshire and has only three ingredients.
Yalias explains: ""Propylene glycol gives you the sensation that you are smoking;
vegetable glycerine carries the flavour and gives you a visual - you can see
something being emitted; and nicotine. This compares with cigarette smoke, which
contains more than 4,000 chemicals. There is a range of battery-powered
vapourisers. You fill the atomiser with liquid and press a button. It emits some
heat which vapourises the liquid.""

It hits the back of my throat in a similar way to a cigarette but with a taste
that is cleaner, slightly sweet and not at all synthetic. As I exhale, Thompson
says, ""We'll have you blowing smoke rings in no time.""

A community has built up around vaping. ""It has become a hobby in a way that
never happened with nicotine patches or even smokers - you won't get them going,
'You must try these Marlboro Reds',"" says Thompson. Yalias describes vaping as
""a consumer-driven response to a public-health problem"". They estimate that 70
per cent of their customers are men but point out that more men smoke cigarettes
too.

Thompson is the only one of the group who has never smoked and says: ""My one
reservation was that opponents suggested that vaping was a gateway to smoking,
but we discussed it and the general consensus was that it is a gateway out. We
are in talks with Cancer Research UK about a donation scheme where we give them
a percentage of our sales. We want to support them while taking people away from
tobacco.""

Tobacco companies have noticed the potential and want in. Is there any money in
it? ""Maybe eventually,"" says Thompson. ""Now our main concern is building a
brand, which is more cash intensive. We want to make a sustainable, ethical
business.""

They have already broken America. After vaping blogger Martyn Parker reviewed
Simple Vape Co they sold out.Now Sanderson's girlfriend texts him when she sees
a model vaping and Yalias says his fiancé is ""a part-time vaper"". All that
remains is for them to convince their girlfriends to ditch the cigarettes.

June 16--HARRISBURG -- A bill that includes state Rep. Gerald Mullery's
legislation to ban nicotine products from school grounds, including increasingly

House of Representatives on Monday.

Mullery's legislation was included in House Bill 954, which would ban the sale

nicotine to minors.

""We all know nicotine is extremely addictive, and products used to ingest it
should not be available to minors,"" said Mullery, D-Newport Township. ""These

It's the time of year when many people decide to quit smoking. Many of those
people will struggle to keep their resolutions. VapeHQ aims to help those people
now and well into the future.

But what is 'Vape' ? Matt West, Vape HQ's Manager says: ""Vaping is an
alternative to smoking which uses water vapour to replace the usual cigarette.
The Vape device, commonly called an e-cig, is filled with a flavoured liquid
which is vaporised to give the same sensation as smoking a traditional
cigarette.You can start with a liquid which contains nicotine and then work your
way to a liquid which has none. It really is an alternative to smoking which
doesn't rely on will power or abstinence.""

Those who have already discovered vaping are also catered for at VapeHQ. Matt
continues... ""It seems that Vapers love to discover new flavours. We will be
introducing new flavours as fast as we can get hold of them. It's almost a
competition between Vapers to get the newest or the most 'out there' flavours
before their friends.· The liquids available range from imitations of the
traditional cigarette and cigar brands to a wide selection of fruits, drinks and
even bubble gum!

So why should you buy from VapeHQ? ""VapeHQ is all about safety and traceability""
Insists Matt, ""We only sell devices and liquids that we can trust, know what's
in them, and have fully traceable suppliers and manufacturers.

After all, you need to know what you are putting into your body and that it has
no harmful ingredients"". VapeHQ has chosen the best liquids on the market and
packaged them under its own brand called Freedom Liquids which are exclusive to
VapeHQ stores.

The VapeHQ difference is that it is a professional business, part of a growing
UK wide network of VapeHQ stores, which insists that the industry becomes
established and trusted. VapeHQ is designed to take vaping away from the market
stalls and back streets and into a cleaner, pleasant environment. The staff are
Vape advisors rather than sales people. If you are new to vaping or know nothing
about it, Matt and the other advisors can talk you through the options so that
you are happy with your choices. You can even try before you buy to make sure
that you are happy with your device and liquids. ""My mobile number is on our
business cards"" says Matt, ""if anyone has a problem or has a question, I'm
always available"".

If you haven't seen Vaping before, pop in and see Matt or any of the other Vape
Advisors and they will happily demonstrate everything for you.

Visit Vape HQ and who knows? You might actually keep this year's resolution!

VapeHQ is open 6 days per week at 23 Outer Circle Road in Lincoln, Opposite the
Carlton Centre. You can get there by tapping LN2 4JA into your SatNav.

E-cigarettes deliver sufficient nicotine to suppress smoking desire and reduce
tobacco withdrawal symptoms in smokers, comparable to Nicorette

LENGTH: 816  words","

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the
following news release:



 A new study, published in the Journal of Regulatory Toxicology and
Pharmacology, found that e-cigarettes share a similar short-term safety profile
as Nicorette® products and are comparable in reducing tobacco withdrawal
symptoms.





 The study, conducted by Fontem Ventures scientists, used a prototype vaping
product with two percent nicotine concentration - the maximum limit prescribed
by the EU Tobacco Products Directive - and found it delivered sufficient
nicotine to suppress smoking desire.



 ""Unlike other nicotine replacement therapies, the vaping product we studied may
offer a viable alternative to cigarettes for those finding it difficult to quit
the behavioural and sensorial aspects of smoking,"" said Tanvir Walele, Senior
Scientist at Fontem Ventures."" The e-cigarette was well tolerated in smokers,
had a similar short-term safety profile to Nicorette®, and clearly has the
potential for use as an aid for smoking reduction or cessation.""



 Many smokers fail to quit because current nicotine replacement therapies do not
deliver nicotine in the same way as conventional cigarettes, nor do they provide
the unique sensory cues or rituals associated with the use of conventional
cigarettes. A growing number of smokers are therefore choosing vaping products
to quit or reduce their cigarette consumption, and to relieve tobacco withdrawal
symptoms.



 ""By clinically evaluating the acute effects of vaping on nicotine blood levels
and its short-term potential for reducing smoking desire and withdrawal
symptoms, this research shows that e-cigarettes offer a smokers a legitimate aid
to reduce or cease tobacco consumption, providing the products comply with
safety, quality and efficacy standards set by a medicinal regulator,"" said
Tanvir Walele.



 Abstract



 ""A Randomized, Crossover Study on an Electronic Vapour Product, a Nicotine
Inhalator and a Conventional Cigarette. Part A: Pharmacokinetics""



 The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nicotine delivered by an Electronic Vapour
Product (EVP) was characterised in a 2-part study in smokers. The study was
designed as a randomised, controlled, four-way crossover trial. Part 1 compared
an unflavoured e-liquid (UF2.0%) and a flavoured e-liquid (FL2.0%) to a
conventional cigarette (CC; JPS Silver King Size, 0.6mg) and a licensed nicotine
inhalator (Nicorette®; 15mg). Part 2 compared e-liquids with increasing nicotine
concentrations (0%, 0.4%, 0.9%, 2.0%). Subjects used each different product for
a daily use session. In Part 1, maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Cmax) for
UF2.0%, FL2.0%, Nicorette® and CC was 3.6, 2.5, 2.5 and 21.2 ng/mL,
respectively. The time to maximum plasma nicotine concentration (Tmax) was
longer for the EVP (UF2.0%, 9.0 min; FL2.0%, 10.0 min) and the nicotine
inhalator (13.0 min) compared to CC (3.0 min). In Part 2, EVP with 0%, 0.4%,
0.9% and 2.0% nicotine produced Cmax values of 0.6, 1.0, 1.9 and 3.6 ng/mL,
respectively. At the maximum nicotine concentration of 2% as prescribed by the
European Tobacco Directive, the EVP achieved nicotine delivery that was
comparable to the inhalator. EVPs thus offer a potential alternative to nicotine
inhalator devices for those finding it difficult to quit smoking.



 ""A randomized, crossover study on an electronic vapour product, a nicotine
inhalator and a conventional cigarette. Part B: Safety and subjective effects""



 An Electronic Vapour Product (EVP) and has been evaluated for short-term safety
parameters and subjective effects in a 2-part study, in smokers. Part 1 compared
the EVP with unflavoured (UF) and flavoured (FL) e-liquid at 2.0% nicotine to a
conventional cigarette (CC; JPS Silver King Size, 0.6 mg) and a licensed
nicotine inhalator (Nicorette®, 15 mg). Part 2 assessed the effect of increasing
concentrations of nicotine in the e-liquid used with the EVP (0%, 0.4%, 0.9%,
2.0%). The study was designed as a randomised, controlled, crossover trial.
Outcomes included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, exhaled carbon monoxide
(CO), clinical laboratory parameters, smoking urges and withdrawal symptoms. In
both study parts, only mild non-serious AEs were reported. No major differences
were observed in AEs between the EVPs and Nicorette®. Exhaled CO levels only
increased for CC. All products appeared to decrease smoking urges and nicotine
withdrawal symptom scores to a similar extent. The EVP had a similar short-term
safety profile to Nicorette® and relieved smoking urges and nicotine withdrawal
symptoms to a similar extent as Nicorette® and CC. Unlike nicotine replacement
therapies, the EVP may offer an alternative for those finding it difficult to
quit the behavioural and sensorial aspects of smoking.

E-cigarette ad gets first airing on British TV

BYLINE: OLLIE GORDON

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 245 words","


UK TELEVISION viewers yesterday saw the first ever advert showing someone
smoking - or ""vaping"" - an e-cigarette.

While adverts for e-cigarettes have been airing for some time, the device itself
and the act of ""vaping"" were prohibited until an amendment to advertising
regulation came into force yesterday morning.

Cigarette adverts have been banned in the UK since 1965, while cigar ads were
halted in 1991.

Due to the considerable growth potential of the e-cigarette market, advertising
could become big business.

Anton Dominique, chief marketing officer at the London School of Marketing, told
City A.M.: ""As of 2013, the market was worth around £200m. That is forecast to
grow to £340m in 2015. In 2013, £8m was spent on all e-cigarette media. Given
the forecast growth of the mar-ket, that figure is likely to rise massively
going forward.""

Rules from the Committee of Advertising Practice (Cap) stipulate that adverts
should not be ""likely to appeal particularly to people under 18""; encourage
non-smokers to use cigarettes; claim e-cigarettes are ""safer"" or ""healthier""
than smoking tobacco; or make any health claims without approval from the
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.

James Dunworth, cofounder of e-cigarette vendor ECigaretteDir-ect, told City
A.M.: ""This advert will provoke a debate. But I don't see the reasoning behind
banning adverts when... products with a similar safety profile - like coffee and
alcohol - can be advertised legally.""

Enough of the nanny-state mentality from city council. Since when do we ban
something

simply because someone thinks it's a nuisance? I find it a nuisance when parents
don't control their kids in fine dining restaurants. Should they be forced to
stick to family-and children-oriented restaurants only?

I see no good reason to ban e-cigarettes from adult establishments and
workplaces. Vaping may look like smoking; however, there are no kids in these
places to influence and I think an adult should be able to distinguish between
smoke and water vapour.

There were scientific facts to back up the dangers of smoking and second-hand
smoke. In the case of e-cigs, where are the facts?

Cases tie e-cigarettes to lung injuries, pneumonia

BYLINE: Raquel Rutledge, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P2C

LENGTH: 1074 words","


MILWAUKEE -A 31-year-old West Virginia woman with no prior lung disease
contracted what doctors say is a rare form of pneumonia after inhaling vapor
from electronic cigarettes.

The woman had been vaping for about three months before being admitted to a
hospital this year with a chronic cough. Soon after, she went into respiratory
failure and was put on a ventilator, according to the doctors who treated her.

In Vermont, a 60-year-old man suffered an acute lung injury and was diagnosed
with hypersensitivity pneumonitis last year after vaping ""red hot cinnamon""
flavored e-cigarettes.

The two cases are among the first to surface highlighting severe lung injuries
that physicians say are related to the use of e-cigarettes and other vaping
devices.

""We are all very curious about this, said Frank Drescher, the doctor who treated
the man at the White River Junction VA Hospital in Vermont. ""I am certain this
is an underreported diagnosis.

A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation in September found high levels of
diacetyl and a second chemical known to cause permanent and sometimes fatal lung
disease in locally made e-liquids and exposed inadequate testing that results in
manufacturers claiming their products are diacetyl-free when sometimes they are
not. There are no requirements that manufacturers test e-liquids, nor are there
any standards to meet.

Known for its links to injuries and deaths of microwave popcorn workers,
diacetyl destroys the lungs' tiniest airways, leading to scar tissue buildup
that blocks airflow. An earlier Journal Sentinel investigation found potentially
dangerous levels of the chemical in coffee roasting facilities and exposed cases
of lung disease in commercial coffee roasters and grinders.

Drescher and his colleague, Graham Atkins, who was also involved with the
Vermont case, said they believe diacetyl may have played a role in their
patient's illness. They said the man first came to the hospital with weakness,
chills and a cough. He was treated with antibiotics and went home three days
later feeling normal.

He returned a month later with the same symptoms, this time with a fever. A CT
scan showed an injury to the lungs that appeared to be related to a chemical
exposure. When doctors asked the man what he had been doing, he said he had been
vaping strongly flavored e-cigarettes - on both occasions before his illness.

Doctors diagnosed him with a severe allergic reaction called hypersensitivity
pneumonitis - more commonly known as ""farmers' lung.

The disease was prevalent among farmers in Wisconsin in the 1970s and 80s. It is
often triggered by inhalation of dust with fungus spores from moldy hay, bird
droppings or other decomposing organic compounds. It's treatable when caught
early but can cause permanent scarring and damage if exposures continue over
time.

""Inhaling chemicals of different sorts can cause all kind of lung diseases,
Drescher said, noting the lungs are a delicate organ with a strong immune
response.

The man stopped vaping and recovered within several days. A follow-up three
months later showed normal pulmonary functioning.

The case was documented in a recent issue of the journal CHEST.

A flavor called Hawaiian Blast made by Maryland-based MaddCatt was the likely
culprit that sickened the woman in West Virginia, according to doctors at West
Virginia University Health Sciences Center.

In an interview, the doctors said the woman had started vaping the flavor -
described as a ""tropical fruity mix with a touch of creaminess - a few months
earlier in an effort to quit smoking conventional cigarettes.

She arrived at the hospital and was quickly transported to the intensive care
unit, her lungs failing. Her symptoms were similar to those of hypersensitivity
pneumonitis: shortness of breath, cough, weight loss and labored breathing.

But after seeing stains on her photo imaging indicating she had inhaled
something fatty or oil-based, they diagnosed her with lipoid pneumonia. She
remained on a ventilator for several days.

""We can't say with absolute certainty that her illness was from the
e-cigarettes, but it sure seems causal, said John E. Parker, a pulmonary
critical care physician who helped treat the woman. The woman recovered within
about a week and was sent home with supplemental oxygen. She stopped vaping.
Tests three months later showed normal pulmonary functioning.

Parker said he was aware of just one previously documented case of lipoid
pneumonia related to e-cigarettes. In 2012, a 42-year-old woman was diagnosed
with the illness after seven months of using e-cigarettes. Doctors suspected the
vegetable glycerin in the e-liquid was to blame.

""We don't know if this is the tip of the iceberg, Parker said. ""Maybe it's going
to be toxic to lots of people or maybe there is going to be a host factor that
leads to individual people getting these diseases.

Parker, an expert on diacetyl who studied cases of occupational exposure to the
chemical in microwave popcorn workers in the early 2000s, said he couldn't be
sure what role diacetyl might have played in his patient's case. A study of more
than 150 sweet-flavored e-liquids last year found nearly 70 percent contained
diacetyl.

""It always takes a broad public health approach with epidemiologists,
toxicologists, pulmonologists and industrial hygienists to really tease out the
(causal) agent, he said.

Parker said he and the other doctors involved in the case plan to have their
case study published in a trade journal in the coming months.

Meanwhile, users of e-cigarettes nationwide who suffer adverse reactions have
been seeking help from the American Association of Poison Control Centers and
have been filing reports with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has
been gathering data on the issue over the last several years.

A 66-year-old female reported suffering a seizure in February 2014 within
minutes of vaping an e-cigarette, according to FDA records. She was treated at a
hospital and an MRI confirmed she had had a seizure. A woman in Missouri went to
the emergency room in January 2014 after having an allergic reaction following
inhalation of a flavor called Great Balls of Fire. Other reports show concerns
from women whose husbands are chain vaping and from those who complain of
headaches and dizziness from exposure to people vaping in public places.

Retail notebook: Diffusion Vapor Shop & Lounge open on Vernon Avenue

LENGTH: 699 words","


Jan. 23--Many people are finding it difficult to kick the nicotine habit, and
they are turning to vapor products.

Aaron Shambeau and Andre Barrett -- both Lenoir County deputies -- were smokers
not long ago. Both wanted to quit smoking and decided to try electronic
cigarettes from local convenience stores, but they were quickly disappointed,
Barrett said.

""They helped a little bit but you found yourself going back to cigarettes,"" he
said.

So they traveled to the shops in larger cities to continue experimenting with
the products. They finally found what they were looking for.

""You get the nicotine, but none of the carcinogens,"" Barrett said of his vapor
products.

Shambeau liked the products so much, he opened Diffusion Vapor Shop & Lounge on
Vernon Avenue, between Pizza Villa and Jackson Carpets, on Dec. 13.

Barrett came on board as a partner Jan. 1.

""This is a passion,"" he said. ""It's really like an enthusiasm that we both
have.""

The shop carries products ranging from pen-style starter kits to intermediate
variable-wattage devices to advanced mechanical products, including
medical-grade organic cotton, for vaping connoisseurs -- passionate folks who
have taken vaping up as a hobby.

There's also a lounge area with a television and customers can try before they
buy, Barrett said.

There are probably hundreds of flavors, and it's the variety of flavors that
attract people to vape instead of smoke.

Barrett said the shop has about 60 flavors, including mint, fruits, desserts and
custard. There are four ingredients in the liquid juice: liquid nicotine,
propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and flavor.

The idea of vaping is that over time people reduce the nicotine, but continue
vaping for the flavor and the habit of doing something with their hands, he
said.

""I started at medium to high nicotine,"" Barrett said, ""and I'm actually down to
the lowest before you can get to zero.""

A year and a half after starting to vape, he said he's now feeling and breathing
better and his clothes, hands and car don't smell like cigarette smoke. Once, he
left the vapor device in his car and tried to smoke a cigarette. ""Disgusting"" is
how Barrett described the experience.

""I tried it and I said I can't even believe I was using these things,"" he said.

Barrett and Shambeau have two part-time employees and will also have a full-time
employee starting in February.

They can handle product problems and answer questions from newcomers to advanced
vapers.

The devices can only be sold to people 18 years and older, and the liquids carry
a warning similar to what's on cigarette packaging. The FDA has stated
e-cigarettes have not been fully studied.

Barrett said the companies from which they buy wholesale use FDA-approved-clean
rooms.

""If you're going to kick the habit completely,"" he said, ""... it's very
inexpensive versus your heavy-duty smokers.""

Diffusion Vapor Shop & Lounge, 1320 W. Vernon Ave., is open 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Saturday and 1-7 p.m. Sundays. For information, call
252-686-5014.

Proposal in Md. fires up 'vaping' advocates

BYLINE: Alissa Gulin

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 869  words","


Vince Shaffer used to smoke four packs of cigarettes a day. Now, he says, he's
nicotine-free, and the smell of cigarette smoke makes him sick.

Adam Fordham burned through two packs a day for nearly three decades. But, the
49-year-old said, he just passed the one-year mark since his last puff.

Rachel Alexander was also a heavy smoker; she says she's coming up on a year of
no cigarettes.

The three Baltimoreans have something in common: They all switched to ""vaping,""
and they've all opened shops to sell the electronic, vapor-producing devices
they swear helped them quit tobacco.

But these products -- e-cigarettes are the most common -- are far more
controversial outside the vaping community, as there's been little conclusive
research about the safety of the devices, which heat liquid into a vapor that
users inhale.

The liquids, called e-juices, are available in hundreds of flavors and contain
varying amounts of nicotine. They're also available without nicotine.

Under current state law, vaping is generally allowed in public indoor places,
although sales to minors are prohibited.

But the city of Baltimore might become the first jurisdiction in Maryland to
treat e-cigarettes just like their tobacco-filled cousins. Councilman James B.
Kraft introduced a bill Monday that would extend the restrictions on the use and
sale of tobacco to electronic smoking devices.

E-cigarettes would be banned inside public facilities, for example, and there'd
be regulations on how the products can be displayed in stores.

The bill will be reviewed by a City Council committee within the next few months
before being put to a vote, Kraft said, adding he thinks the measure has
widespread support in the council.

Some vape shop owners said e-cigarettes have become so popular they doubt the
measure would have much impact on their business.

""Most of our customers aren't just into vaping because they can do it inside a
movie theater or the mall,"" said Rachel Alexander, co-owner of District Charm
Vapory, which opened in Pigtown a few weeks ago. ""People do it to cut out the
tobacco but still get the nicotine or because they like the sensation of smoking
something. ""

But Shaffer -- who co-owns NettMix Custom Vapes & E-Cigs -- said even though his
Dundalk shop is outside city limits, new regulations would reduce demand for the
product because he's so close.

Fordham, who opened The Vapory in the Midtown neighborhood in July, also said
regulating e-cigarettes might slightly reduce business. All three shop owners
said they think it's misleading to lump e-cigarettes together with tobacco
products.

""Some people vape because they like the flavors of hookah but don't want the
nicotine and tobacco,"" Alexander said. ""My business partner vapes (liquid with]
zero nicotine, so considering that the same as smoking tobacco is ridiculous to
me. ""

And Shaffer, who also uses liquids without nicotine, said equating e-cigarettes
to tobacco cigarettes takes away the devices' credibility as smoking cessation
tools.

""It upsets me that this (bill] would force people who just quit cigarettes to go
stand outside with the smokers if they want to vape,"" he said. ""It's like taking
the accomplishment away from somebody. This is something that's actually helping
people quit. If anything, we should encourage it. ""

Kraft said in addition to health-related concerns for adult users, he worries
vaping could be seen as glamorous -- like smoking was years ago -- and that
children will be unable to distinguish between the two. He also said if vaping
is allowed in places like stadiums, some people might try to get away with
smoking tobacco.

A similar statewide bill died in a General Assembly committee earlier this year
-- probably because there isn't enough evidence about e-cigarettes' health
effects, said Kathleen Hoke, director of the Legal Resource Center for Public
Health Policy at the University of Maryland.

Electronic cigarettes are restricted in some areas of the state, though. Harford
County prohibits the devices on all county-owned property. They've also been
banned by several hospitals and county school systems.

Baltimore County education officials are working to ban the products by this
fall, Hoke said, adding she ""wouldn't be surprised"" if the Maryland State Board
of Education soon does the same.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a proposal last week to regulate
the ingredients and ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors (some states did not
prohibit those sales). It's unclear whether those rules will move forward.

Even though the health effects of vaping are unknown, advocates say they're
satisfied knowing it's the lesser of two evils.

""There are four ingredients in e-cigarettes compared to the 4,000 in tobacco
cigarettes,"" Fordham said. ""My cat can look at those two lists and figure out
which is safer. ""

But Kraft isn't so sure.

""I would rather err on the side of caution and just include these products under
our existing tobacco regulations,"" Kraft said. ""If at some point in the future,
we do have additional scientific evidence, then we can go back and review it. ""

Vaping Santa
I know Santa isn't always heralded as the picture of perfect health, but
smoking -- excuse me -- ""vaping""?
That's just not very Santa-like. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids seems to
agree.

The electronic cigarette company Vapor Shark is under fire after putting up a
Miami billboard of a vaping Santa.
Along with the photo of a smiling St. Nick holding what I assume is a Vapor
Shark e-cigarette is this slogan: ""I don't always vape, but when I do, I choose
Vapor Shark."" The quote is attributed to Kris Kringle.
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids calls the ad a ""new low in copying Big
Tobacco's playbook."" Old tobacco ads for decades featured Santa happily smoking
a pipe or cigarette, sometimes with a sack full of cigarette cartons instead of
toys, according to the group.
""Not only was this an attempt by tobacco companies to associate smoking with
the good cheer of the holidays, it was also clearly aimed at Santa's most rapt
audience: children.""
""Santa's just as much on the minds of kids as ever. And this year Vapor Shark
is associating him with e-cigarettes.""
Even some e-cigarette users spoke out against the ad on the company's Facebook
page. The company's chief executive officer, however, told ABC News he
disagreed with the dissenters who claimed the billboard targets children.
""It's a difference of opinion"" Vapor Shark CEO Brandon Liedel told ABC News.
""The only type of kid that would be persuaded by Santa Claus is a 5-year-old. I
think a gorgeous woman would be more persuasive for a teenager.""
Pets protecting kids from allergies
Scientists have for years said kids who grow up with dogs and cats are less
likely to develop allergies or asthma.
And now, a team of researchers is getting closer to explaining why that is --
going beyond the speculation that kids with pets are exposed to more bacteria,
viruses and parasites and, therefore, build up immunity.
Researchers at the University of Michigan exposed a group of mice to the dust
in the home of a dog owner. The researchers then doused those mice, and a group
of mice that wasn't exposed to dog dust, to two asthma-related allergens.
The mice exposed to the dog dust showed much lower inflammation in their
airways and produced less mucus than the dust-free mice, according to a Time
Healthland article.
According to the researchers, the microbes in the dust affected the community
of organisms in the mice. The changes influenced the immune response of the
mice and their ability to fight off certain allergens, according to the
article.
The dust associated with dogs also seemed to prompt an immune response against
microbes that have been linked to asthma in kids. The results could lead to
future studies on how the bacteria could treat or protect children from
allergies and asthma, according to the article.

Thieves steal 5,000 of vaping equipment from shop

BYLINE: Daniel Holland

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 217 words","


POLICE are hunting thieves who stole £5,000 worth of vaping equipment from a
Radcliffe shop.

Officers reported that thieves broke into The Vaping Works, in Stand Lane, via a
back door between 9.40-11.40pm on Saturday, January 23.

The shop, which only opened in November, has posted a full list of the items
stolen on its Facebook page, Grumpy Juice. The items include both hardware
equipment and e-liquids.

Its owners have appealed for members of the public to inform police if they are
offered any similar equipment under suspicious circumstances.

A Grumpy Juice spokesman said: ""We really enjoy having a shop in Radcliffe and
won't let a couple of bad apples change our view of a great community.""

The day after the break-in, a post on the shop's Facebook page said: ""Our little
shop was broken into last night and we had quite a bit of hardware taken.
That'll be back up and running in a few days. The Grumpy Juice e-liquid site and
sales are not affected. Vape on!""

The stolen items were listed as vapour flask stouts, vapour flask classics,
vapour flask lites, Reuleaux RX 200 temperature control mods, Coolfire IV iSub G
kits, Grumpy Juice e-liquid, Craggy juice, and The Vaping Works branded
e-liquids.

Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting the reference number
2615 of January 23.

Vexing clouds not made of smoke

BYLINE: TOM LYONS

SECTION: B; FL News; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 648 words","


COMMENTARY

Saying so will irk some people who insist we now have a ""nanny state,"" but I
nominate the ban on public indoor smoking as one of the best improvements ever
achieved by a government regulation.

There was no way to sue each smoker for sharing their carcinogens, after all.
Banning the burning of tobacco in indoor places where nonsmokers also breathe
has made life immeasurably better for so many people.

This good change has not required any reefer madness legislation, either. Our
jails and prisons are not being filled with violators. The compliance is
reasonably near 100 percent in large part because most smokers got smarter and
now tend to accept it as reasonable not to make nonsmokers share their smoke.

I've been reluctant to mention a practice that is similar and yet remains common
in all sorts of unexpected public places. But Barry Garman, a local military
retiree who says he has lung issues related to his Vietnam service and Agent
Orange, says he has had enough of breathing vapors from other people's
e-cigarettes.

Garman contacted me to say he has more than a pet peeve about the smoking
substitute also known as ""vaping,"" which allows nicotine addicts to inhale their
drug of choice without

creating smoke.

Instead, there is a cloud of visible vapor. It is supposed to be far less
harmful, and is often referred to as odorless.

Not so to Gorman.

He says secondhand vapor became an issue for him after multiple encounters that
often began with smelling it. One was in a mall food court. He was eating with
his wife and teenage son when he sensed the cloud of vapor wafting from the next
table.

""Three guys were vaping it up like crazy,"" Gorman said.

He didn't say anything or otherwise make an issue of his irritation. But he
later called the mall's management to ask what the rules were and suggest that
mall customers shouldn't be subject to secondhand vapor.

He was told that Florida law allows vaping even in food courts and the like, and
that there were no plans to ban it at the mall. After all, there is no evidence
as yet of risk to bystanders.

Gorman says this assumption is part of the problem.

In a small cafe where he smelled the e-cigarette vapor and had to look carefully
to see where it was coming from, he soon realized the owners - the chef and the
cashier - were both vaping. Both seemed to be trying to do so discreetly by
turning their backs when inhaling.

That seemed ridiculous to Gorman, because the effort to hide showed that they
knew it could bother some customers.

""Why didn't they go outside?"" he asked.

I'm sure we know. It is inconvenient for serious nicotine addicts to go out as
often as they would need to. They figure that even if some don't like the vapor,
people can't hate it nearly as much as cigarette smoke. They may also think they
have conceded enough ground.

Gorman is probably unusually sensitive, much as some are unusually bothered by
perfumes, although he didn't mention any extreme physical reaction. Though he
said he has read about illegal drugs being used in some e-cigarettes - ones that
he really does not want to breathe - a local law enforcement vice squad leader
says he knows of no cases of that being done locally in a public place.

Even Gorman admits vaping is not anywhere near as bad for him as indoor, public
smoking used to be. But, he says, how bad should it have to be? What nonsmoker
isn't at least a little bothered by encountering someone else's nicotine vapor
cloud?

I'm not saying we need another law, but some consideration on the part of
e-smokers would be a good thing, and that requires awareness that their vapors
are not charming to others.

Some businesses already have signs banning vaping. It is a decision I assume is
all about pleasing customers. Not all of them, but many.

I wonder how many more business managers will soon make the same savvy move?

Ministry plans nationwide crackdown on e-cigs, vape liquids

BYLINE: Azreen Hani

SECTION: C - CENTRAL; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 475 words","


The Health Ministry will embark on a nationwide crackdown and confiscate
e-cigarettes and vape juices that contain nicotine as the government intensifies
its efforts to put a stop to vaping.

The ministry's deputy DG Datuk Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman (picture) said the
action to confiscate e-cigarettes and vape liquids which contain nicotine is
provided under the Poisons Act 1952.

""On e-cigarettes, we will enforce the Act on the usage and the selling of the
products. For vaping, our message is do not vape.

""We will begin our operations to confiscate vape liquids containing nicotine.
Our pharmaceutical enforcers have drawn up the SOP (standard operating
procedure) on actions to be taken,"" Dr Lokman said at a press conference in
Kuala Lumpur yesterday.

He also said that the SOP does provide a differentiation between vape liquids
with and without nicotine.

Previously, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam was quoted as saying
that the ministry would take action against those who are selling nicotine-based
products.

Dr Subramaniam said the law does provide the ministry with the power to seize
nicotine liquids.

Nicotine is classified as a Category C poison under the Poison Act which means
that both nicotine and products containing nicotine can only be dispensed by
authorised pharmacists and premises.

Nicotine in tobacco products such as cigarettes does not fall under the Act.

The Malaysian Reserve in September reported that more tobacco smokers are
switching to vaping as a way to quit smoking besides jumping on the vape
bandwagon as a lifestyle choice.

Malaysia is also one of the leading vape markets with 30% of China's vape
products destined for Malaysia.

Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) in a report said vaping has become a
phenomenon and it is gaining traction among Malaysians.

""It is estimated that there are approximately 400,690 adult vapers in Malaysia,""
HLIB said based on Bank Negara Malaysia statistics and World Health Organisation
survey estimates.

Based on this figure, vapers account for 8.7% of the 4.6 million smokers in
Malaysia, HLIB said.

""Our concern is we are normalising smoking with vaping. That's dangerous. It's a
new trend with unknown longterm effects,"" Dr Lokman said, adding that the
ministry will not support any action that could contribute to health problems.

""As a public healthcare expert, I would even ban cigarettes. But do we have the
political will to ban it? We don't.""

Dr Lokman along with Datuk Dr Abdul Razak Abdul Muttalif, the director of the
Institute of Respiratory Medicine in Kuala Lumpur, have made their
recommendations to the government on the issue.

""It took hundreds of years for people to know the effects of cigarettes. We
still do not know the effects of e-cigs in the future. That is why we want to
start early to stop the selling and usage of e-cigs,"" he said.

E-cigarettes likely to become part of city smoking prohibitions

ABSTRACT

Vaping regulations a go from Internal Affairs. On to City Council

FULL TEXT

Chico >> Prohibitions on lighting up downtown and in city parks may soon include
electronic forms of smoking, with a recommendation by Internal Affairs this week
to pass such a recommendation on to the City Council.

The committee voted 2-1 with Andrew Coolidge dissenting to modify the city's
smoking regulations to include vaping and e-cigarettes, with a clause to model
the town of Paradise in exempting FDA-approved nicotine therapies. The city has
prohibited smoking within 20 feet of business doorways, windows and outdoor
cafes since October 2012, and in the city's parks, greenways and open spaces
shortly thereafter. Smoking is also prohibited in City Plaza, Caper Acres and
portions of Children's Playground.

The new restrictions would expand to include e-cigarettes, which use small
batteries to heat a flavored liquid, usually containing nicotine, until it
produces a vapor. The changes were initiated by the youth group Kids Leading
Everyone Against Nicotine, and supported by Councilor Ann Schwab and City
Attorney Vince Ewing, who said it also provides the opportunity to clear up
other inconsistencies within the city's existing prohibitions.

Citizen Raul Raygoza supported extending the regulations, saying he is concerned
about the erosion of social norms against smoking.

""My understanding is that they are to some degree less harmful. That doesn't
make them safe and it doesn't make them safe to be around,"" he said.

More than 130 jurisdictions in California have included e-cigarettes with their
smoking restrictions, including Oroville, Paradise, Redding, Anderson and Shasta
County, Raygoza said.

""Sometimes when we address something small ... we have the opportunity to make a
really big change,"" he said.

Just because someone is using a vaporizer doesn't mean they are using tobacco or
nicotine, Coolidge said.

""If someone is vaping, they are having some nicotine through water and a couple
of chemicals enter their lungs and they are exhaling. There isn't any tobacco
involved whatsoever,"" he said. ""... My concern is what kind of slippery slope
are we going down?""

He later questioned if changing the regulations meant he could be cited for
vaping just water in the regulated areas, and he predicted that if the city
updates its ordinance to include e-cigarettes, people will challenge it. It
could result in regulating people who may not be creating any harm, Coolidge
said.

""No matter whether it is a nicotine substance or a regular substance, it is
something that is a distraction and it shouldn't be used in an environment in
the public where people do or do not know what is being smoked,"" Councilor
Reanette Fillmer said.

Also Tuesday, the committee voted 2-1 with Coolidge dissenting to establish
council policies for alcoholic beverage establishment density standards,
including license types, saturation levels and specific areas within census
tracts. Putting guidelines into the city's formal Administrative Procedures and
Policies will help the City Council with whether to approve declarations of
public convenience or necessity for alcohol licenses without imposing additional
cost to potential business owners and would provide early insight to such
businesses on whether the council is likely to approve such a declaration, said
Community Development Director Mark Wolfe.

""It wouldn't be as if every time we have to reinvent the regulatory wheel,"" he
said. ""There would be some basis for discussions ... As of right now, we don't
have that baseline policy.""

The concept is to establish limitations to prevent another Mangrove Mini Mart
situation, where an existing business is put at risk of failure due to the
council's rejection of a declaration of public convenience or necessity, a
decision that was later reversed, Councilor Tami Ritter said.

""We were kind of making the decisions willy-nilly because we didn't have a set
of standards,"" she said.

Assistant City Manager Chris Constantin said such policies could help the
council with consistency in treating every business fairly by defining
conditions and criteria for approval as a matter of policy. If a business
chooses to go through the process regardless of the policy, the council can then
approve or deny it.

""We don't want the perception we are siding with one license over another, that
we are giving special favors,"" Ritter said. ""We have to have that transparency
with someone who wants to start a business.""

Georgetown to allow vaping at e-cigarette specialty shops

GEORGETOWN - Customers can get a chocolate bacon flavored electronic cigarette
at Allin Still's store in Georgetown, or any other combination of 400 cake and
candy flavorings.

But the Georgetown City Council recently passed one of Central Texas' most
aggressive ordinances restricting electronic cigarettes, and Still says the new
rules are hurting his 2-year-old business, the Peace Pipe Vapor Store.

The ordinance, effective April 23, banned the smoking of electronic cigarettes
in public places. It also prohibited people younger than 18 from buying or
possessing e-cigarettes.

Since then, Still said, sales are down 10 to 15 percent because customers were
not allowed to smoke in his store. On a good day the store attracts 75 to 80
people, and some prefer to smoke inside so they can test the flavors, he said.

Electronic cigarettes heat up a solution including nicotine and flavorings to
create a vapor that users inhale. Instead of smoke, users exhale the aerosol.

Still raised his concerns to city government. The council responded Tuesday by
voting unanimously to ask city staff to amend the ordinance so that people could
smoke inside stores that sold only vaping devices.

""I didn't have the intention of causing you any anxiety or making you think you
couldn't continue with your current business,"" City Council member Rachael
Jonrowe told Still at the meeting.

Still said the vote was a ""great relief"" for himself and his wife. ""We felt like
our city was working with us.""

People younger than 18 are still forbidden from entering a vaping store in
Georgetown. Vaping stores also are not allowed to share a common wall with any
business that allows minors inside.

The Peace Pipe Vapor store is in a stand-alone building along Austin Avenue near
Georgetown High School in Georgetown.

Still, a Vietnam veteran who previously had a historical renovation business,
said he and his wife opened the store because they wanted to help people stop
using tobacco.

He and his wife had used e-cigarettes to kick a 50-year habit of smoking
cigarettes, he said. ""We decided if this worked for us, it could work for other
people and everybody we knew smoked,"" he said.

Smokers who arrive at the store wanting to quit tobacco can get decreasing
amounts of nicotine put into their solution for their electronic cigarettes,
Still said.

Dr. Stanley Glantz, the director for the Center for Tobacco Research and
Education in California, said studies show electronic cigarettes are not
effective in helping smokers get off nicotine.

Allin Still said his experience shows otherwise: 1,800 people have signed a
board in the store saying they have used e-cigarettes to quit tobbaco.

Vape gathers linguistic steam to become Word of the Year 2014;
Oxford Dictionaries settles on term for using e-cigarettes after the word's
usage more than doubled in the last year.What do you think should be the word of
the year? Tell us in the comments below

This was the year of vaping, according to Oxford Dictionaries, which has chosen
""vape"" - the act of inhaling from an electronic cigarette - as its word of 2014
after use of the term more than doubled over the last year.

Vape - defined as to ""inhale and exhale the vapour produced by an electronic
cigarette or similar device"" - beat contenders including slacktivism, bae and
indyref to be chosen as Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2014. The shortlist
is compiled from scanning around 150m words of English in use each month,
applying software to identify new and emerging usage. Dictionary editors and
lexicographers, including staff from the Oxford English Dictionary, then
pinpoint a final selection and an eventual winner, which is intended to be a
word judged ""to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of that particular
year and to have lasting potential as a word of cultural significance"".

The concept of slacktivism also took off this year, said the publisher, defining
it as ""actions performed via the internet in support of a political or cosocial
cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement"", and pointing to the
Ice Bucket challenge, the no make-up selfie and the hashtag #bringbackourgirls
as three examples of the trend.

""It was inevitable that vocabulary around the subject of the Scottish
independence referendum would make its mark on the lexicon,"" it said of the word
indyref, while bae is a form of endearment which ""originated in African American
English and has been propelled into global usage through social media and lyrics
in hip-hop and R&B music"".

But it was vape which won out for Oxford's experts, who said that language
research shows its use has more than doubled compared to 2013, as the fad for
electronic cigarettes goes mainstream.

""A gap emerged in the lexicon, as a word was needed to describe this activity,
and distinguish it from 'smoking',"" they said. ""The word vape arose to fill this
gap, and it has proliferated along with the habit."" There is now even a vaping
lexicon, according to the publisher, with coinages include vape pen and vape
shop, e-juice - the liquid which converts to vapour when an e-cigarette's
battery is activated - and vaporium, ""a place where e-cigarettes may be vaped or
in which vaping equipment can be purchased"".

""As vaping has gone mainstream, with celebrities from Lindsay Lohan to Barry
Manilow giving it a go, and with growing public debate on the public dangers and
the need for regulation, so the language usage of the word 'vape' and related
terms in 2014 has shown a marked increase,"" said Oxford Dictionaries' editorial
director Judy Pearsall.

The word was added to OxfordDictionaries.com in August 2014, and is currently
being considered for future inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary. It is
dated to a New Society article, ""Why Do People Smoke"", from 1983, which
described ""an inhaler or 'non-combustible' cigarette, looking much like the real
thing, but ... delivering a metered dose of nicotine vapour. (The new habit, if
it catches on, would be known as vaping.)""

Its use was tracked by Oxford Dictionaries during the 1990s, with posts
referring to it on the UseNet bulletin board system, and mainstream usage taking
off from 2009.

The word of the year shortlist also included budtender, ""a person whose job is
to serve customers in a cannabis dispensary or shop"", contactless, ""relating to
or involving technologies that allow a smart card, mobile phone, etc to contact
wirelessly to an electronic reader, typically in order to make a payment"", and
normcore, ""a trend in which ordinary, unfashionable clothing is worn as a
deliberate fashion statement"".

Previous winners of Oxford's Word of the Year include 2004's chav, 2011's
squeezed middle and 2013's selfie. This year vape won the vote for the
publisher's editorial teams in the UK and the US; sometimes, the international
departments make different choices. In 2009, simples won the vote in the UK, but
the US went for unfriend, while in 2006, the UK went for bovvered, and the US
for carbon-neutral.

Earlier this autumn, Chambers plumped for overshare as its own word of 2014,
while Collins went for photobomb.

What do you think should be the word of 2014? Let us know in the comment thread

                   The Vancouver Province (British Columbia)

Top doc wants e-cigarettes regulated; Health: Chief medical officer alarmed when
11-year-old was allowed to buy device in Tsawwassen store

BYLINE: Susan Lazaruk, The Province

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 642 words","


B.C.'s top doctor is calling for electronic cigarettes and ""vaping"" to be
regulated after an 11-year-old was able to buy one in a Tsawwassen store.

But one anti-smoking activist said that the new product that allows users to
inhale vapour that's been flavoured and in some cases infused with nicotine is
difficult to regulate because it exists in a grey zone.

The province's chief medical officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, and others concede not
enough evidence exists to determine whether puffing on the battery-operated
inhaler without producing ""smoke"" is dangerous, but said everyone should avoid
it.

""Sucking up vapour that's got ethylene glycol and other chemicals in it is
probably not a good idea,"" he said.

But, he said, the bigger public concern is that vaping would become an
acceptable social habit: ""Young children are vaping. It's just a gateway to
smoking.""

Health officials are writing to schools to ban it from schoolyards and Kendall
and the medical health officers from the province's health authorities are
drafting a letter to urge Health Canada to regulate the devices.

""They should be restricted to people over 19 years,"" said Kendall. He and other
anti-tobacco activists worry the practice of holding and inhaling a plastic
device like you would a cigarette will undo decades of education to dissuade
young people from the notion that smoking is cool.

Joe Braico of Delta discovered that himself when his 11-year-old son called for
him to check out an e-cigarette that vaporized a blueberry-flavoured substance
the boy had bought from a local lottery store.

""He said, 'Hey, dad, look,' and he's trying to blow a smoke ring with this
thing,"" said Braico.

Braico returned to the store, the Tsawwassen Lottery Centre at Tsawwassen Town
Centre Mall, and the woman who sold the $10 device to him assured him there was
no nicotine in it and told him it was like candy. She refused him a refund and
told him there was nothing illegal about selling it to kids.

The staffer, who said her name was Nanshim, told The Province she sold the
e-cigarette to him. ""It's not illegal,"" she said, saying she sold it to ""not
many children. They are very curious. It's just for fun.""

Braico said he discovered many of his son's friends had the same device and said
sales should be restricted, although he doesn't oppose their sale to adults. ""My
friends at work are using them to quit smoking and they're loving them,"" he
said.

E-cigarettes with nicotine are marketed online as a way to quit smoking and
Kendall conceded that as a ""harm-reduction"" tool they may be less harmful than a
cigarette.

But the nicotine version can't legally be sold in Canada because it would then
require approval by Health Canada, said spokesman Gary Holub.

In 2009, Health Canada issued a product safety warning, ""advising Canadians not
to purchase or use electronic smoking products, as these products may pose
health risks and have not been fully evaluated for safety, quality and efficacy
by Health Canada.""

Veda Peters of the B.C. Lung Association said e-cigarette-makers are careful not
to make any claims for their products as a quit-smoking tool, so that they won't
be subject to government review.

Paul Bergen of the Electronic Cigarette Trade Association of Canada told the
Delta Optimist newspaper that e-cigarettes are safe and designed as adult
pleasures.

Melodie Tilson of the Non-Smokers Rights Association in Ottawa said her group
doesn't insist on banning the devices and they may help people quit smoking, but
said the federal government needs to regulate them, especially so they aren't
sold to kids. ""They're in a regulatory grey zone,"" she said.

Kendall said B.C. may be able to regulate them as a ""health impediment,"" as was
done recently with trans-fats.

Smoking lite? No, vaping's a lungful of fun for hipsters;
Prescribing ecigarettes may help a few smokers to quit but most users are
fashion victims, not addicts, writes a former puffer

BYLINE: JENNY HJUL

SECTION: NEWS REVIEW;FEATURES; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 992 words","


There is something about the smell of cigarette smoke and the furtive air of
real smokers that makes me regret, fleetingly and stupidly, the day I quit.
Although I am glad I am an ex-addict and would never want to repeat the giving
up process, I find myself drawn towards the coughing pariahs who gather outside
buildings.

Vapers, as those who smoke ecigarettes are known, are different. While proper
smokers cock a snook at society with their reckless selfdestruction, the vaping
brigade seem to be people who do things by halves.

They do not huddle in doorways, but walk among us, sucking on their odourless
pen-like devices, the vapour coming out of their noses.

Now there are moves to make ecigarettes available on the NHS, as a ""smoking
cessation aid"". The battery-powered vaporisers that simulate smoking are said to
be 95% less harmful than tobacco.

While they are not risk-free, they deliver a nicotine hit without the
carcinogens associated with breathing in smoke. They are the most popular
quitting method in Britain and doctors estimate that if every one of Britain's
8m smokers switched to ecigs, 75,000 lives a year could be saved.

It is hard to argue against the experts, and impossible to make a rational
argument for real smoking. People who smoke fags are irresponsible and selfish.
They do not deserve our help. Vapers, on the other hand, are heeding the medical
advice, they have a social conscience, and they do not pollute the atmosphere.

But they still look ridiculous. That in itself is not a reason to balk at their
being subsidised by the health service, of course, though it is good enough for
the reformed smoker in me.

More objectively, there are many causes more deserving of health spending than
smokers, even the electronic kind, as the public has been quick to point out.
While air ambulances are funded by donations and cystic fibrosis sufferers must
pay for their drugs, there can be no justification for providing ecigarettes on
prescription.

Smokers choose to smoke, whereas others who depend on limited NHS resources do
not choose to be sick or injured. And vapers, of all people, have money to burn.
When I gave up (at about 3am on January 8, 2001), a packet of 20 cost £4 to £5.
Now, they are double the price. Ecigarettes, being rechargeable, will amount to
huge savings for anyone making the switch.

Anyway, smokers in some parts of the country can already claim nicotine patches
on the NHS; they do not need any more financial assistance.

But for me this is not so much about the money as the principle. If I could quit
(Marlboro) at the same time as my husband (Silk Cut), and if we could endure the
cold turkey, practically marriage-ending, withdrawal symptoms without props, why
can't they? Giving up was memorably awful. I chewed gum, read Allen Carr, and
drank faster and more frequently. It was hell but I did it.

And I was not even the most hardened smoker I knew. A colleague, back in the
days when you could smoke in the office, would drive home with his handkerchief
tied to the radio aerial. This, he explained, was to put his wife off the scent
because she had threatened to divorce him if he did not quit.

Another workmate took the brave decision to kick the habit after he devised a
way to smoke in the shower. ""I knew then it had gone too far,"" he said.

But at least these desperados managed to wean themselves off through willpower
alone. What happened to willpower? By resorting to NHS ecigarettes, medics are
condoning a certain weakness of character that makes yesteryear's quitters verge
on the heroic.

They are also, to a large extent, missing the point about vaping. Among the UK's
estimated 2.6m people who regularly use ecigarettes, there are, no doubt,
genuine smokers who want to stop.

But vaping has become a craze, with devotees who have no intention of abandoning
their new hobby. It has even been likened to a sub-culture, complete with
customised vaporisers and a vaping lexicon.

A whole ecigarette industry has sprung up, with stores and accessories and an
online presence. There appears to be an active vaping community that trades tips
and probably considers itself cool in a geeky way.

As the owner of one ecigarette shop told the Digital Trends website: ""You're not
downgrading from a cigarette. You're getting something more ... you're able to
fine-tune the experience."" At an ecigarette convention, real (or ""analogue"")
cigarettes were banned by vaping enthusiasts, proof if it were needed that these
people are a breed apart from proper smokers.

Can you imagine Bogart or Bacall with an ecig, or Paul Henreid vaping up to
Bette Davis in Now, Voyager? I rest my (cigarette) case.

?Pringles have been defended since David Cameron was snapped eating
paprika-flavoured ones on an easyJet flight to www.Portugal.No damage was done
to the prime minister's image, or to the brand's profile.

But I pity his fellow passengers. I recently sat next to a couple munching
Pringles (original flavour) on a flight which, rather like Dave's trip to the
sun, was a short haul. It was neither time for breakfast, lunch nor dinner but
the compulsion to eat once airborne seems to be strong.

Many carriers hand out Pringles as their snack of choice, so it is hard to fly
anywhere without hearing or smelling them. I do not like Pringles, but until I
can demonstrate an allergy I will have to put up with them, by proxy. However, I
do wonder why passengers cannot refrain from eating on one or two-hour trips.
The PM would have been given a decent meal before leaving for the airport and
another on arrival at his ultimate destination.

Do people who polish off whole tubes of Pringles on aeroplanes do so at their
desks too? I bet they don't. Flying, or perhaps travelling generally, prompts
the hunger response. Or is it boredom? Whatever, our prime minister showed
himself to be a man of the people, not in his choice of airline, which was
probably contrived, but in his Pringles moment, which looked more genuine.

Letters to the editor: TfL's loss is Network Rail's gain

SECTION: LETTERS

LENGTH: 929 words","


Sir Peter Hendy's move to run Network Rail is good news for rail travellers
throughout the United Kingdom. It is ironic that the Government has to find a
chap who is a ""bus man"" to run a major rail company, but that simply shows how
poor the talent pool is among the senior and middle management of British rail
companies.

Another irony is that the man who recently called railway companies ""s***"" (as a
user of Southeastern trains, quite accurately in my view) is now going to spend
most of his working day dealing with them. Paul Twyman

Blunt, brusque even, Sir Peter Hendy is neither an anodyne bureaucrat nor a
silken PR man hiding behind slogans. In many respects his direct style and zeal
for calling a spade a spade personified London. He is the most influential
figure TfL/London Transport has had since Frank Pick, with an impact that can be
seen in the transformation of the capital's buses, Tube and, increasingly,
suburban rail.

The days when London's transport system was inferior to Paris have long gone.
Though an efficient transport system at the Olympics will be seen as his
greatest success, his legacy will continue well into the future with Crossrail
and a vastly increased profile for TfL at a national level.

He is perhaps more hard-headed than emollient - but then again, who said running
transport in London was ever easy?Nick Biskinis, Clapham Transport Users' Group

Now that Sir Peter Hendy is leaving, one would hope that London would realise
that what the capital wants and what the capital needs are two very different
beasts. We must realise that TfL is not the best option for the running of
London's railways.

Even the most basic research clearly shows that delays and suspensions on TfL
services are on a near-equal par with those of the train-operating companies,
and that TfL is flouting the National Rail Conditions of Carriage by not
offering super-off-peak and advance fares on London overground services.

How can TfL claim to be better than the train-operating companies when it is not
honest about its own failings, and claims to offer the best fares when it so
clearly does not? Ian Roberts

You report that with the crisis in Network Rail some of its biggest and most
vital modernisation projects are likely to be cut or scaled back - and yet the
pointless duplication known as HS2 goes ahead? It doesn't make sense.J H Taylor

Hopefully one of Sir Peter Hendy's first announcements will be to confirm that
the Barking to Gospel Oak line electrification will go ahead next year. Graham

Dangers of vaping are still not known

It's good news that Guy's and St Thomas' NHS foundation trust is banning the use
of e-cigarettes in all its wards and outside areas. Also that patients and
visitors spotted using them will be asked to stop, but will be offered
replacement therapies to help them quit. Vaping can help users of conventional
cigarettes give up smoking, but it could have serious long-term side-effects, so
we need to be cautious.

The Government and NICE should amend existing legislation on cigarettes to
include vaping to both control and limit what e-cigarettes may or may not
contain, and where they may be used.

To get people off conventional cigarettes is commendable, but vaping may well
raise new, unknown dangers to both users and those nearby (particularly passive
users visiting hospitals who might have already given up smoking and/or vaping).

Legislation should restrict manufacturers from introducing new substances to
make vaping more attractive to users until such substances are proven to be
safe.Brian Bean

Litigation is not the answer to pollution

While the protection of infant lungs is obviously desirable, litigation is just
as obviously not a cure [""Schools may be sued if pupils fall ill because of
pollution"", June 25]. Mass litigation promises to be as much a boon for lawyers
as phoney whiplash injury claims have been in recent years.

Relocating schools in urban areas is clearly as impractical as shifting busy

A23 in Streatham needs speed limits

It comes as no surprise to learn that Boris Johnson has failed to take action
over three of London's five most dangerous junctions [News, June 25]. This
inertia must come to an end before there are any more tragedies. In Streatham we
have seen numerous incidents on the A23 over several years, including the death
of a motorcyclist following a collision with a truck on June 8.

More signage is needed on the A23 to reinforce the 30mph speed limit, and a
20mph limit should be enforced in certain sections. Traffic-calming measures
such as speed cameras and bumps are also needed along the A23.Councellor Danny
Adilypour (Labour, Streatham South)

Women can use Garrick's library

For Professor David Mayer, father of gender-equality activist Catherine Mayer,
to claim that women do not have full access to the ""unique theatrical library""
of the Garrick, a club to which he has belonged since 1989, is nonsense upon
stilts [Londoner's Diary, June 25].

The Garrick does not discriminate between male and female scholars, all of whom
may have full access to our library under the supervision of our female
librarian. This has absolutely nothing to do with the question of whether the
club should admit women to its membership, as the professor surely knows full
well.Christopher Silvester, member of the general committee, Garrick Club

'Vaping' less harmful than smoking cigarettes

BYLINE:  Daily mail London

LENGTH: 192 words","


RESEARCH has found that more women than men switch from smoking to ""vaping"". The
findings come days after Public Health England concluded that, on ""the best
estimate so far"", e-cigarettes were about 95 percent less harmful than
traditional tobacco cigarettes.

The official body added that one day e-cigs could be dispensed as a licensed
medicine in an alternative to anti-smoking products, such as nicotine patches.

Previously, the e-cigarette market had been dominated by men, but a survey of 36
000 customers this year by the vaping brand, VIP, showed that 53 percent of
users were female.

Although some experts fear that the rise in popularity of e-cigarettes could
glamourise the act of smoking, others believe that it could hold the key to
helping to reduce smoking-related illnesses for future generations.

According to the ""Statistics on Smoking 2015"", an estimated 2.1 million adults
in Britain use e-cigarettes. Of those, 1.3 million use both tobacco and
electronic cigarettes. The key users are smokers and ex-smokers.

Only 0.14 percent of users are non-smokers, according to the ""Opinions and
Lifestyle Survey"" from the Office for National Statistics.

Confusion clouds vape `war'

BYLINE: Aina Nasa; Tharanya Arumugam

SECTION: Pg. 2

LENGTH: 852 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: AS the ""war"" on the use of nicotine-filled vaping liquids and
e-cigarettes becomes more muddled, those for and against the use are stepping up
the fight.

The Health Ministry, rooted in its stand that liquids used in vaping devices
cannot contain nicotine, said those selling such liquids were breaking the law.

It said sellers also risked having their supplies seized and compounded.

The vaping community, in an immediate reaction, wants to push its case through
legal channels after accusing ministry enforcers of taking a high-handed
approach by carrying out raids to seize nicotine-filled e-liquids, which they
declared were ""contraband"".

As the ministry makes it case, explaining that it is empowered by the law,
including the Poisons Act 1952, its deputy minister took the issue to another
dimension by questioning the raids, saying sellers should be given time to get
licensed.

The statement by Datuk Seri Dr Hilmi Yahaya was made less than 24 hours after
Health deputy director-general Datuk Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman said laws and
regulations sanctioned only pharmacists and pharmacies to trade nicotinated
products.

It was because of this, said Dr Lokman, that giving sellers a deadline to be
registered was not an option to be considered.

The New Sunday Times asked Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam about
the clashing views.

He said the ministry would release a statement to clarify the grey areas in the
issue.

A few hours after Dr Hilmi made the remark, Health director-general Datuk Dr
Noor Hisham Abdullah posted on Facebook, with the former's statement attached.

""Under the law, only registered and licensed pharmacies and doctors are allowed
to sell nicotine, which comes under the Poisons Act, while tobacco sales are
governed by the Food Act.

""It is best for vape sellers to cease operations until a new regulation is
announced.""

The Malaysia e-Vaporisers and Tobacco Alternative Association (Mevta) yesterday
appealed to the government to consider legalising members of the vaping
community as sellers of nicotine-filled e-liquids.

The ministry underlined its definition of vapes and e-cigarettes, saying the
former could only be referred to as smoking devices that used liquids that did
not contain nicotine. E-cigarettes applied to devices in which nicotine is
delivered.

On Wednesday, many were caught off guard when the ministry launched simultaneous
raids nationwide to seize nicotine-filled vape juices at some 300 e-cigarette
stores and stalls.

The raids reportedly caused losses of up to hundreds of thousand of ringgit,
leaving store owners crying foul and questioning the ministry's move.

Some threatened to go ""underground"" to ply their trade.

Yesterday, Dr Hilmi said he was shocked by the raids and described the move as
drastic, adding that the store owners should have been given time to legalise
their businesses by applying for licences to sell nicotine-filled e-liquids.

Meanwhile, anti-smoking advocates called on the cabinet to review its decision
against banning e-cigarettes and vapes.

Malaysian Council for Tobacco Control (MCTC) president Dr Molly Cheah said
legislation on nicotine came under the purview of the Poisons Act 1952, which
stated that the alkaloid cannot be supplied without a prescription from a
healthcare professional.

MCTC, she said, supported the ministry's interim measures, including enforcement
of the Poisons Act.

""There have been enough evidence of the dangers of e-cigs, such as the recent
incident of a vape exploding. However, the government has failed to ban the
products,"" she said yesterday, adding that another concern was children becoming
attracted to vaping.

She said there were 4.7 million smokers in Malaysia and an additional one
million vapers.

""We would like to ask the government how many cigarette smokers had kicked the
habit because of vapes.

""The government's failure to regulate vaping will elevate the tobacco industry
to a dangerous level,"" she said, adding that one in eight countries had banned
e-cigs, according to the World Health Organisation.

Meanwhile, Smoke-free Healthy Life Association president Murthapavalar
Krishnasamy said vaping was close to cementing its place in the recreational
lifestyle of many Malaysians, despite the efforts of organisations and the
medical authorities to curb the prevalence of smoking, which kills six million
people worldwide annually.

""This new form of smoking will impede efforts to curb the habit among the
younger generation.

""A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Paediatric
found that teens who used e-cigs were more likely to start smoking tobacco
cigarettes.

""Studies also showed that e-cig users often end up being dual users - still
smoking conventional cigarettes as well as using e-cigs. They never quite kick
smoking traditional cigarettes and there is evidence that shows the device
actually keeps the nicotine addiction alive,"" he said.

Muslim medical practitioners' group i-Medik president Prof Dr Azmi Md Nor
expressed concern that some people, especially youngsters, might misuse vapes,
such as by using marijuana flavoured e-liquids.

Zero sense

Sometimes little bills can imply even more than big bills can. Take a proposal
by Newport News state Sen. John Miller, which rests on several questionable
assumptions:

(1) that government should step in to settle differences of opinion among
private citizens;

(2) that government knows best, and is therefore capable of settling those
disagreements the right way;

(3) that ignorance is an acceptable reason to prohibit something; and

(4) that prohibiting one thing justfiies prohibiting something different.

It takes all of those assumptions and more to rationalize Miller's bill, which
would prohibit the use of electronic cigarettes in restaurants.

Many large restaurant chains already have prohibited vaping, as they're
perfectly entitled to do. Some smaller ones have not - and that is their right,
too. Nor does there seem to be a huge public demand for the smaller ones to
enact a ban. It's possible that the occasional customer objects to someone else
vaping nearby, but reports of angry confrontations over the issue are roughly as
common as unicorns.

That's likely because e-cigarette vapor is vastly more healthful than cigarette
smoke. It doesn't smell bad, and it contains none of the thousands of toxic
chemicals that cigarette smoke does - usually just nicotine and propylene glycol
or vegetable glycerine. That's why many smokers turned to vaping in the first
place.

Miller isn't convinced: He claims e-cigarette users are ""spewing God knows what
into the atmosphere."" But why take the trouble to actually find out before
introducing legislation? A policy of ""ready-fire-aim"" is so much easier.

Besides, Miller says, ""we banned smoking in restaurants,"" so it's appropriate to
ban vaping as well. That's a stunning non sequitur.

Miller's proposal has all the logic and proportionality of a school
zero-tolerance policy that treats an aspirin tablet the same as a rock of crack
cocaine. In fact, it's worse. At least in schools, the government has a
legitimate purpose in restricting what students, who are minors, bring onto
school property.

Miller has no good reason to treat adults like children - or to impose his own
personal preferences on the policies of privately run establishments. Here's
hoping his colleagues tell him to butt out.

As regulators circle, e-cigarettes take hold in Oklahoma

BYLINE: MATT RICHTEL

SECTION: FINANCE; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 1654 words","

ABSTRACT

Regulators may be starting to circle, but in Oklahoma, the e-cigarette industry
is going full steam ahead.

FULL TEXT

Nick Whitson, who is 32 and covered with enigmatic tattoos - the number 13, an
upside-down cross - stood in front of a table scattered with dozens of bottles
of colorful liquids and a handful of syringes, preparing to mix Trevor Curren
his usual.

Mr. Whitson manages a small shop called Vaporlicious in an Oklahoma City strip
mall. He sells flavored nicotine liquids for devices known variously as
e-cigarettes, vape pens, tank systems and e-hookahs. In the past 18 months, the
number of vaping shops in the state has jumped from a handful to 300, with names
like Vapor Haven, Vapor World, Creative Vapor and Patriotic Vapes.

In the back room of Vaporlicious, Mr. Whitson took a syringe, drew several
milliliters of pomegranate-flavored liquid from a plastic container and squirted
it into a small bottle. Then he injected a mixture of nicotine and two additives
into the red liquid. He capped and shook the bottle, wiped his hands on his
jeans and walked to the front counter. He handed the concoction to Mr. Curren,
who held the e-liquid up to the light, appreciating its vivid color.

Mr. Curren, 47, took up chewing tobacco at age 10 and switched to cigarettes in
seventh grade. When he discovered e-cigarettes in 2011, he quit smoking - and
within six months, he said, was able to taste his food and started jogging
again. He also regained self-respect and now holds his head high at the Harvest
Church in Norman.

''I feel like I'm one step closer to God,'' he said. So precious is his
e-cigarette that he wears it on a lanyard around his neck: ''This takes the
crime out of smoking.''

Around the United States, there are an estimated 5,000 vape shops. But Oklahoma,
with 6 percent of those shops and a little more than 1 percent of the United
States population, has a disproportionate share.

Business is booming. ''You can't even get commercial retail space in Tulsa right
now in that 1,200- or 1,500-foot range because everyone is opening a vapor store
- it's crazy,'' said Chip Paul, who owns two of the nearly 50 stores in Tulsa
and who estimates that a typical store can bring in $400,000 a year after
start-up costs of less than $50,000.

What has made Oklahoma a vaping hub is a heavy concentration of smokers, many
desperate to quit, who are creating both demand and supply. Converts to
e-cigarettes are taking advantage of the relatively low cost of starting a
business to become zealous sellers.

''The trend moves from the coasts inward and from Oklahoma outward,'' said
Daniel Walsh, the chief executive of Purebacco USA, a company in Michigan that
ships e-liquid to retailers nationwide and tracks the retail trends. ''It's
somewhat anomalous,'' he said of Oklahoma. Or it could be, he said, that
''Oklahoma is simply ahead of the trend.''

Last week, the United States Food and Drug Administration for the first time
proposed rules for regulating    e-cigarettes, including prohibition of sales to
minors and requirements that producers register with the agency and disclose
manufacturing processes.

But many crucial questions still fall to the states. Should there be indoor
vaping bans, for example, or excise taxes? The F.D.A., in its release on
Thursday, did not address marketing or whether to ban flavorings, which some
critics say appeal to children. State-imposed limits played a big role in
reducing traditional cigarette use, and health officials said states could play
a similar role this time, pulling back the reins on e-cigarettes until more is
known about their potential hazards.

Oklahoma has already taken a few steps. Gov. Mary Fallin has prohibited vaping
on state property and last week signed a law prohibiting sales to minors. Some
18 percent of Oklahoma high school students have experimented with vaping,
nearly double the national average. While the F.D.A. rules would also prevent
those teenagers from buying    e-cigarettes, they are now just proposals.

The prospect of further regulation troubles many small-business people here,
including Sean Gore, a former rodeo cowboy and recovered meth addict turned
consultant to the oil and gas industry, who has become a leader in the state's
vaping industry. On May 1, he plans to open his third vape shop in the Oklahoma
City area, and he also serves as chairman of the state industry lobbying group,
the Oklahoma Vapor Advocacy League. He welcomes regulations like outlawing sales
to minors. But others worry him, like product regulation, which he fears could
subject even small vape shops that make their own products and mix their own
liquids to federal oversight.

He also opposes state action to raise taxes, limit marketing or ban vaping
indoors. More rules, he fears, would work only to benefit deep-pocketed tobacco
companies that have also entered the $2 billion e-cigarette industry.
Regulation, he said, will take ''a product that has the potential to save
thousands of lives and give it back to the industry that's killing people.''

Most galling to him are rules that prohibit e-cigarette makers from claiming,
without providing scientific evidence, that their products are safer than
cigarettes. ''It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out these products
are much safer than cancer sticks,'' he said.

Oklahoma is big smoking country. Two years ago, 23.3 percent of the adults were
smokers, one of the higher rates in the United States - only 11 states were
worse. Nonetheless, that is an improvement from 2011, when smokers accounted for
26.1 percent of the adult population and only three states had higher
percentages.

Current and former state health officials say smoking rates have been moving
lower since 2001, when the figure was 28.7 percent. They say it reflects
education efforts, increases in cigarette taxes and indoor smoking bans. The per
capita annual consumption of cigarettes in the state has fallen to 67.2 packs in
2013 from 108 in 2001.

But Mr. Gore asserted that state officials simply will not acknowledge what he
sees as the clear reason behind Oklahoma's improvement relative to other states.
''All of a sudden it just happens in one quick swoop about the time e-cigarettes
come into the market,'' he said. ''This is the largest step forward in tobacco
harm reduction in  last 50 years.''

Given the short history of e-cigarettes, it is not clear how well they work as a
way to quit smoking in the long term. But there is anecdotal evidence. A novel
study of 215 vape shop customers in Oklahoma found that 64 percent of them had
completely quit cigarettes, something verified through Breathalyzer tests that
measured carbon monoxide, which is present in smokers.

''It's incorrect to say it hasn't been a cessation tool,'' said the study's lead
researcher, Theodore L. Wagener, a psychologist who is co-director of the
Oklahoma Tobacco Research Center and an assistant professor at the University of
Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. ''It's working for some people.''

But he does not know if his sample was representative of the population. ''We
don't know if those are just the cream of the crop,'' he said.

Mr. Gore does not have the full support of the vaping world. In fact, some shop
owners take issue with his views and what they characterize as his bulldog
style.

Among his detractors are John and Stephanie Durst, whose OKC Vapes is one of the
most popular vape shops in Oklahoma City.

The Dursts have come a long way since 2011, when Ms. Durst was working at Panera
Bread and started vaping in place of smoking. She was saving a lot of money -
she and her husband had been spending as much as $225 a month on cigarettes -
but she was carrying around a handful of cruder, early e-cigarette devices and
thought that there had to be a better way. She started contacting flavor and
nicotine manufacturers in China, ordering online, mixing her own e-juice - green
apple, blueberry, strawberry - and selling it.

By June 2011, Ms. Durst was handing out business cards at bars and advertising
e-cigarettes on Craigslist. Five to eight cars a night would come by their
house. ''It got to the point we had tell our neighbors: 'We know it looks like
we're dealers, but we're trying to run a business out of our home,''' Mr. Durst
said.

The Dursts now own four vaping stores and expect total sales this year to exceed
$4 million.

The Dursts want vaping to succeed, and they think it can, even with regulation.
Unlike Mr. Gore, they are fine with vaping bans in public parks and even in
restaurants. They also favor licensing and health inspections of people making
e-liquids. ''I can't preach that enough,'' Mr. Durst said in a phone interview.

''Tobacco self-regulated themselves into rich bank accounts and killed a lot of
people,'' Mr. Durst continued. ''Let's not screw up with e-cigs.''

Mr. Gore's group has formed an alliance with Big Tobacco, which was involved in
crafting a state bill prohibiting youth access to e-cigarettes and one against
state excise taxes. Several lobbyists for the tobacco industry declined to
comment for this article.

Mr. Gore finds his loose alliance with Big Tobacco to be useful for now, but
also unnerving, given the companies' financial muscle.

''They're getting into the e-cig industry,'' he said. ''We can't stop them.''

He contends that they are profiteers who do not care about people's health. He
sees Oklahoma's mom-and-pop shops differently. They are run by the victims of
cigarette companies, he said, who have found an antidote to the ill effects of
tobacco - and who just might see their own payday in the process.

''We're in it to make a buck and raise our families as well,'' he said. ''Who's
not?'' But he said he had a different long-term aim: getting people to quit
cigarettes, then to reduce their nicotine levels on e-cigarettes until they are
free forever of addiction.

''If we work our way out of a job,'' he said, ''I don't have a problem with
that.''

Restrictions on vaping the 'wrong priority'

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 180 words","


MOVES to restrict e-cigarettes in Wales have been slated as a Welsh Government
""vanity project"" in a scathing attack by the Welsh Lib Dems.

The Welsh Government had originally wanted to ban so called vaping from all
enclosed public and work places in the Public Health Bill.

But health minister Mark Drakeford scaled back the initial plans in the face of
opposition pressure last year.

The Minister has now produced a list of public places where vaping could be
banned, including pubs that serve food, schools, train stations and on public
transport.

Welsh Lib-Dem leader Kirsty Williams accused Prof Drakeford of pursuing a
""vanity project"" while people in North Wales had languished on waiting lists.

Ms Williams said the Welsh Government needed to focus its attention on the
increased pressures on the NHS and getting Betsi Cadwaladr University Health
Board out of special measures, rather than banning e-cigarettes.

She said: ""I don't think the people of North Wales would expect the Health
Minister to be spending his time on this particular issue - it is simply the
wrong priority.""

n I'm so pleased to find some sanity among all the ecigarette hysteria (I've not
had a cigarette for six months and before that I smoked 40 a day).

People have been saying lunatic things about vaping, starting with the World
Health Organisation, which urged a ban on indoor use.

Now experts have expressed ""shock and surprise"" over the ""alarmist""
pronouncements and point out that heavy-handed regulation would cost lives by
""crippling the competitiveness"" of vaping and forcing smokers to stick with
tobacco.

The editor of the journal Addiction, Professor Robert West, says that if all the
UK's current smokers took up vaping, 54,000 lives a year might be saved.
However, Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health,
said that ecigs should be renamed ""nicotine sticks"".

Look, it's like this: cigarettes contain 70 known carcinogens; as far as anyone
is aware, ecigarettes do nowhere near as much harm.

Of course more research is needed, but for now you have known carcinogens on the
one hand and apparently largely benign devices on the other, and people like me
freed from 30-odd years of smoking. Ecigs should be available on the NHS.

Caution over prescription e-cigarettes

SECTION: LETTERS

PUBLIC Health England's suggestion of prescribing e-cigarettes on the NHS should
been cautiously welcomed.

PHE says the devices are 95% less harmful than tobacco and suggests vaping could
be a ""game changer"" for helping people to give up smoking. I'm glad to see an
institution like PHE make such a declaration about e-cigarettes after some
needless scare-mongering about vaping.

However, I am concerned this suggestion of NHS involvement with vaping chimes
too much with what the European Union has been saying. Are we once more dancing

Expedite circular on vape ban in schools

BYLINE: Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye

SECTION: Pg. 24

LENGTH: 266 words","


THE Education Ministry should expedite the issuance of a circular to schools and
educational institutions on guidelines prohibiting the use of vape.

I support the ministry's decision to ban vaping by students and teachers in
schools and educational institutions due to health concerns.

There is no study that proves the use of vape is safe and does not adversely
affect health.

In fact, survey findings by the World Health Organisation and international
medical journals have raised concerns about vaping, which is linked to nicotine
addiction, abuse of vape kits for drug use and long-term effects that can lead
to cancer.

A report presented at the Annual Congress of the European Respiratory Society in
Vienna, Austria, in 2012 showed that electronic cigarettes could damage users'
lungs. The devices could cause less oxygen to be absorbed by the blood and
result in a significant increase in airway resistance, blocking air from getting
in and out of lungs.

Research by Universiti Sains Malaysia's National Poison Centre found that vape
liquids contained uncontrolled nicotine levels and could negatively affect
users.

As such, the use of vape in schools and educational institutions should be
disallowed in view of its long-term disastrous effects on health.

The ban should be extended to private schools and institutions. Teachers and
lecturers should set an example by not using vape in schools.

Many people, including youth and teenagers, view vaping as trendy. We certainly
do not want to see students vaping in schools.

PLANET OF THE VAPES;
Mink Shoals vape shop goes `ape' with nicotine-replacement gear

There's a breath of somewhat-fresher air in the Mink Shoals/Charleston area
these days.

Planet of the Vapes is a vape shop that opened on May 11 on Pennsylvania Avenue,
providing supplies for those 18 and older who choose to transition from nicotine
cigarettes to e-cigarettes.

While vaping has its detractors and skeptics who question how safe, health-wise,
the practice is, those who have switched from smoking nicotine products to using
vapor often tout its advantages to them over tobacco. None more so than Planet
of the Vapes co-owner Mike Mooney.

""Our main goal of our business is to get people to quit smoking cigarettes, the
Roane County resident said. ""I haven't had a cigarette in two years, myself,
thanks to vaping. I can honestly say I don't have a cigarette with my morning
coffee anymore. I breathe better. I feel better.

""We have lots of people who come in who have quit smoking -- the majority of
them. There are still a few who will, every now and then, hit a cigarette
because they can't totally commit yet, but I'd say 98 percent of our customers
are now nonsmokers, thanks to vaping, said Mooney.

""We also cater to the younger generation with Cloud Chasers, he said.

Nick Arthur, of Mink Shoals, works as Planet of the Vapes' ""wick, wire and mod
technician and has chosen Cloud Chasers for his nicotine substitute. He said he
started smoking tobacco when he was 15 and, by vaping, he hasn't had a tobacco
cigarette in four years (he turned 21 this month).

Cloud Chasers are box-mod e-cigarette devices, in which the nicotine, if any, is
modulated in strength by a battery-powered attachment.

Many of the vape ""juices are made locally or regionally, such as Madd Capp from
Cumberland, Maryland; Twisted from Clarksburg; and 51-50, which is made in
Charleston. Planet of the Vapes Manager Linda Lewis, of Charleston, said
supporting area businesses is an important tenet at the shop.

Planet of the Vapes carries nearly 60 flavors of vape juices, ranging from
tobacco-like facsimiles to esoteric choices such as bubble gum, strawberry,
creme de menthe and vanilla cupcake. Mooney said new flavors are added to the
on-site roster regularly.

Co-owner Donna Carper said she was inspired to invest in Planet of the Vapes
with Mooney after a few ""uncomfortable experiences she had while patronizing
other vape shops, particularly with little to no instruction and explanations of
the products and their use. As such, the Planet of the Vapes employees pride
themselves on providing friendly, helpful service to their customers, beginning
and experienced vapers alike. (And Carper, a Clay County resident, was the one
who came up with the pun-packed Planet of the Vapes name.)

Adjacent to Planet of the Vapes is Mooney's other business venture, Head Hunters
Styling Co. Salon and Day Spa. The original Head Hunters salon operated for more
than 30 years in another section of Mink Shoals. Mooney purchased that business
from its original owners a few years ago and moved it to its current location in
March. He said the new locale permitted opening the day spa, which includes
massages. Six specialists make up the Head Hunters' present staff, although
Mooney mentioned he currently has openings for a facial technician and a nail
(mani-pedi) technician.

Along with hair, nail, skin and other care services for the entire family, Head
Hunters Styling Co. Salon & Day Spa sells an assortment of Redken hair-care
products.

Planet of the Vapes, 2777 Pennsylvania Ave., Charleston, can be reached at
304-345-8989 and followed on Facebook. Hours of operation are 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Friday and 1 until 7 p.m. Saturday; the store is closed on
Sundays.

Head Hunters Styling Co. Salon & Day Spa is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesdays
through Thursdays, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays; the
establishment is closed on Sundays and Mondays. The phone number, for further
information or to make appointments, is 304-343-2049.

Planet of the Vapes and Head Hunters Styling Co. Salon & Day Spa are located
across Pennsylvania Avenue/U.S. 119 from Harding's Family Restaurant and near
Barone Brothers Pizza, just off Interstate 79 Exit 1.

Both maintain Facebook pages.

comment

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 222 words","


IT is extraordinary that the 'vaping' revolution could have taken place without,
thus far, any effort whatsoever by the Government to police or control it. Most
extraordinary of all has been the failure to impose any sort of restriction on
those aged 18 years and under.

There is, of course, no medical evidence to prove that e-cigarettes are
addictive.

Indeed, there is considerable evidence to suggest that those who find themselves
hopelessly addicted to nicotine can wean themselves off tobacco with one.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that they project a glamorous image of smoking
that is miles away from the reality. It is easy to imagine a teenager who has
experimented with vaping moving on to traditional tobacco products - just as
cannabis users move up to 'hard' drugs.

The new regime proposed by the Department of Health, under which vendors of
e-cigarettes would be obliged to display health warnings and there would be
restrictions on advertising, does not, unfortunately, go as far as the eminently
sensible alternative Bill drawn up by Senators John Crown and Averil Power. But
it is at least a welcome step in the right direction.

The next logical step, however, must be a ban in bars and restaurants, as
Professor Crown and Ms Power have proposed in their own private members' Bill,
which hopefully will gain some traction.

Province banning sale of e-cigarettes to minors;
Flavoured tobacco also targeted in sweeping law that cracks down on 'vaping'

BYLINE: Robert Benzie Toronto Star

No ifs, ands or butts about it.

The Ontario government is banning all flavoured tobacco - including menthol -
and vaporizing e-cigarettes for teenagers as well as curbing their use
throughout the province.

Associate Health Minister Dipika Damerla on Monday unveiled sweeping legislation
that treats the unregulated electronic smokes like traditional cigarettes.

""If young kids see people smoking or 'vaping,' they're more likely to take up
smoking or 'vaping,'"" Damerla told a Queen's Park news conference.

""It's the wild west right now.""

Under the proposed law, the sale and consumption of e-cigarettes would be banned
for anyone under 19 as of Jan. 1, 2016, and their use would restricted to the
same places as regular cigarettes.

Scofflaws would face cash fines. Store owners selling flavoured tobacco to a
minor would see the maximum fine doubled to up to $200,000 - and $600,000 for a
corporation that engages in youth sales.

For selling e-cigarettes to a child or teen, the fines would be up to $100,000
for a shopkeeper and $300,000 for corporate lawbreakers.

Currently, e-cigarettes can be used anywhere - including places where cigarettes
have long since been banished from, such as bars, restaurants and other public
spaces.

At the same time, flavoured tobacco, which cigarette companies often use to lure
young smokers, will be outlawed, though the prohibition on menthol will be
phased in.

Damerla noted the government will also step up the fight against untaxed
contraband tobacco, as Finance Minister Charles Sousa announced last week.

Dr. Scott Wooder, past president of the Ontario Medical Association, said the
measures ""will save lives.""

""Ontario's doctors welcome this legislation that works to protect our children
from flavoured tobacco products and reduce the number of youth who start
smoking,"" he said.

But the National Coalition Against Contraband Tobacco - whose members include
Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council, the Canadian Convenience Stores
Association, and the Ontario Chamber of Commerce - warned the move would lead to
more black-market cigarettes. ""Banning legal menthol products, about 5 per cent
of the market, will only drive consumers to underground illegal channels,"" said
the coalition's Gary Grant.

The Liberal bill is inspired by NDP MPP France G#233;linas (Nickel Belt), who
has been pushing for a ban on flavoured tobacco since 2008.

Also Monday, Damerla announced the government would revive legislation requiring
fast food chains to post calories on menus. It would make Ontario the first
province to do so.

Oregon: Multnomah County moves to ban e-cigarette sales and use by minors, and
in workplaces

LENGTH: 364  words","

DATELINE: Salem


Multnomah County of Oregon has issued the following news release:

The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners on Thursday took the first step
toward prohibiting the sale, use and possession of e-cigarettes by minors, and
barring vaping in the workplace.

In a 5-0 vote, commissioners, acting as the Board of Health, adopted a policy to
prohibit vaping and other inhalant delivery systems in any place of employment
where smoking is already prohibited. The order also bans sales to, and use and
possession by, people under age 18.

Commissioners will take final action March 5 on the ordinance to implement the
Board of Health order. The new law could take effect 30 days after the final
vote.

Chair Deborah Kafoury said that eight years ago, e-cigarettes were not even sold
in the United States. Today, vaping is a common sight across the country.

""The complete lack of regulation and education about all these products that has
made for a lot of confusion. Today, we will bring some clarity to this issue, ''
Kafoury said.

The board's actions came after three briefings and four public hearings on the
dramatic increase in vaping and, e-cigarette use. Use among Oregon's 11th
graders has tripled and one in 10 Multnomah County high school students has
tried inhalant delivery systems the Health Department reports. Public health
officials say the unregulated liquid can contain dangerous chemicals and
nicotine, which is highly addictive and is shown to affect teen brains

""People should not vape where they can not smoke. If you are a kid you will not
be allowed to buy or possess e-cigarettes. If you are a store, you will not sell
them to youth,"" Kafoury said.

Community organizations and health professionals have supported the proposed
actions and asked the board to license retailers. Vape shop owners and employees
have supported the ban on sales to minors but asked to be exempted from the
county's Smoke-free Workplace Law so their customers can continue to sample
their products indoors.

CHAMBERSBURG &GT;&GT; Borough council voted Monday night to postpone a
resolution that would keep borough employees from ""vaping,"" or inhaling through
a nicotine delivery system, while at work.

Three labor unions representing borough employees, the Chambersburg Police
Officers Association, the International Association of Firefighters and the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees preferred to
address the motion during regular contract negotiations.

Receiving consent from the labor unions is necessary to move forward with the
motion to ban vaping while on duty, officials said.

""Our employers can, theoretically, vape on duty,"" said borough manager Jeffrey
Stonehill. ""It's not something I'd like to see, but I can't impose that rule.""

The council voted unanimously to table the motion until further notice.

The next council meeting will be on Feb. 23.

DBKL 'not banning vaping in the city'

BYLINE: Koi Kye Lee

SECTION: Pg. 13

LENGTH: 427 words","


KUALA LUMPUR: LOCAL authorities here want traders to stop selling e-cigarettes
or e-liquids at their premises, especially at stores that sell electronic
products.

Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) licensing and petty traders department director
Ibrahim Yussof said it was not banning vaping in the city, but merely stopping
traders from selling the device.

Speaking to the New Straits Times yesterday, he said applications from vape
traders or operators had been rejected because there was never a licence to sell
these products.

""If there are applications from traders for vape products, we will not issue a
licence. Some traders have defied regulations and sold these products under
electronic licenses issued to them.""

Ibrahim said those doing so should stop before the enforcement team seized their
products, especially if they failed to respond to the show-cause letter sent to
them.

Asked if there were plans to draft a new licence for vape traders, he said no
specific licence was being drafted. He said many states had also banned the sale
of vaping products.

""We are not drafting licenses for vape. Not only that, the Health Ministry has
cautioned the public against the use of e-cigarettes as it may be more harmful
than cigarettes.""

Ibrahim said reviews were still being conducted and that was one of the reasons
why licences would not be issued to vape traders.

On whether vaping would be banned in Kuala Lumpur, he said it was still being
discussed with stakeholders, such as the Health Ministry.

States that had banned the sale of e-cigarettes included Johor and, more
recently, Kelantan.

Johor authorities banned the sale of e-cigarettes after Sultan Ibrahim Sultan
Iskandar ordered the closure of vape outlets, effective Jan 1.

Kelantan's local government, housing and sports committee chairman Datuk Abdul
Fattah Mahmood said the 350 operators in the state had 14 days, starting from
Wednesday, to close their businesses.

The Health Ministry had conducted raids last month to weed out the sale of
e-cigarettes and e-liquids and this prompted a group, called the Malaysian
Organisation of Vape Entities, to seek a meeting with the Domestic Trade,
Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry.

Another group, the Malaysian E-Vaporisers and Tobacco Alternative Association
(Mevta), called for proper regulation on the usage and selling of e-cigarettes
and e-liquids.

Mevta had earlier called for better regulation on the usage of the devices.

It was also seeking approval from the Department of Standards Malaysia to have
the e-liquid bottles labelled properly.

Some words are great pretenders

BYLINE: SUE WIGHTON

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 466  words","


EVERY year the Oxford Dictionary singles out a new word as ""word of the year""
(WOTY for the cognoscenti). Last year's word ""selfie"", barely qualifies as a
bona fide word, let alone one fit for the mantle of WOTY.

This year's word is ""vape"". How do I know this? Because somehow, in the
freakishly internet-connected world we inhabit, my computer network knows I'm a
word-nerd and news of vape's win found its way to my screen.

I confess, until its elevation to this high honour, I'd never heard of vaping.
Apparently to vape is to smoke an electronic cigarette. This virtual cigarette
delivers flavoured nicotine in vapor form; trend-setting smokers are using
vaping as a transition from smoking to giving up the dreaded weed. Vaping is
cool.

Confusingly the actual object - the e-cigarette itself - is also called a vape.
So you vape your vape in the same way you smoke your smoke and drink your drink.

I'm imagining the WOTY awards' ceremony, held in some draughty, hallowed hall in
Oxford. The short- listed words are sitting around, alphabetically arranged,
nervously awaiting the announcement.

Look, there's ""slacktivism"" up the back holding a placard. Typical. Slacktivism
means supporting worthy causes with minimal effort, like signing online
petitions. Oh and I can see ""bae"" in the front row next to ""app"". Bae (short for
babe) is the new term for significant other.

And the winner is â[#x20ac]¦ with a world-weary exhalation, ""vape"" slinks to the
lectern to accept the gong, vaping on a long e-cigarillo, all sultry and
self-satisfied, while ""selfie"" looks on from the sidelines, taking snapshots of
itself as consolation.

I'd like to start a new award - for the most annoying word of the year. A meme
is sort of a cultural infection, copied and spread exponentially via the
internet. It's invariably a vapidly vacuous video, crapulous cartoon or photo
with caption, meant to shock or amuse while reflecting the Zeitgeist. Memes are
""cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate and respond to
selective pressures"". Pardon?

Another really annoying and pointless word is ""event"". Want to lend weight to
something ordinary? Call it an ""event"". We no longer have a storm, or a couple
of days of rain. These inflate themselves to storm events, rain events or
weather events.

Another pet hate of mine are those portmanteaus masquerading as real words. I
recently came across the reductive ""listicle"" - a piece of writing in list form.
Try this listicle: The Nine Most Annoying New Words Ever. When it comes to
words, I'm a mossback (conservative). Like Winston Churchill, I reckon the
""short words are the best, and the old words best of all"". So when I encounter
moronic linguistic upstarts like meme, vape and selfie, I'm afraid I lose
patience.Sue Wighton is a Brisbane freelance writer.

FOR THE VAPING AND BEER CROWD, CHEERS TO VAPOUR

BYLINE: JUSTIN GRANT

SECTION: TBT; BARFLY ON THE WALL; Pg. 49

LENGTH: 742 words","


Let's get this out of the way: Vaping is an easy target. Vape culture-a phrase
that's even somewhat startling to type-appears ridiculous to most outsiders,
resulting in mockery and derision from non-smokers and ""traditional"" smokers
alike. I get it-I've had my share of laughs at vaping's expense. But do vapers
really deserve such scorn?

After a night in what most would consider to be a cool, not-at-all-lame bar, I
woke up the next morning with the familiar congestion that accompanies time
spent in places that allow smoking. The acrid stench of cigarette smoke remained
fresh on my clothes and in my hair. No one laughed.

Later that afternoon, I stopped by VaPour, a Clearwater beer and wine bar that
doubles as a vape lounge and retail shop. One of two locations (the other in
Ybor City), VaPour is off Ulmerton Road, in a small unit of a decidedly un-hip
strip mall.

A decal on the door proclaims VaPour to be ""a smoke-free establishment,"" which
made for an interesting contrast to the dense white clouds of fruit-scented
vapor that greeted me upon entering. I'm talking San Francisco morning, Silent
Hill levels of fog-the kind you'd expect to see in an unusually fragrant college
dorm. If it were cigarette smoke, the bar would be downright uninhabitable.

On the other side of the cloud, however, was plain old breathable air. Sure, the
scent of cartoonish, tutti-frutti-cotton-candy flavoring continued to waft over
from the other side of the room, but it was awfully pleasant in lieu of the
burning, caustic smoke to which I am accustomed.

VaPour is a compact space, featuring a vape bar and beer bar situated on
opposite sides of the room. There are a few flat-screens for sports, news and
Playstation, as well as a gigantic poster on the wall that is really not helping
the credibility of vape enthusiasts (it's the Mona Lisa, mid-vape).

The space is minimal and attractive, with wall lanterns, a modern chandelier and
ceramic lamps hanging over the beer bar. If you ignore the vape component and
just go for the booze, you'll find a pretty standard setup: a dozen taps and 30
or so bottles in a cooler, a few house wines, and a couple of flight boards.
There are some local brews, from Cigar City, St. Pete Brewing and Yuengling, as
well as a few rotating seasonals and specialty brews, such as Leinenkugel
Harvest Patch Shandy.

It's entirely competent, but the average beer enthusiast probably won't feel
compelled to visit for beer alone. But what about someone who's trying to quit
smoking but always feels the urge to light up when drinking? Or how about
self-conscious vapers who aren't comfortable filling up their local taproom with
dense plumes of green apple-scented vape clouds? For these folks, VaPour is a
winning proposition.

There's another draw, in the form of kratom. Purported to produce a mellowing
effect without causing outright inebriation, kratom is a bitter tea that's
gaining popularity in the area. At VaPour, kratom comes with flavor shots to
balance out the bitterness. How about strawberry cheesecake-flavored kratom tea?
In the context of a hybrid vape-and-beer lounge, that actually sounds
reasonable.

Everyone that I've mentioned VaPour to chuckled a bit at the concept. But if
we're willing to be objective, it becomes clear that VaPour is kind of a cool
idea. Why not provide a smoke-free space for vape enthusiasts who like drinking
beer?

In 2016, we have to accept that vape culture is a real thing and that maybe it's
not the worst thing in the world-especially when considering that smoking in
bars generally gets a pass. Though it's admittedly not for everyone, there are
plenty of people out there who could use a place to vape and drink. VaPour fills
this emerging niche nicely. As an added bonus, your clothes and hair won't stink
afterward.

WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE UP CIGARETTES FOR VAPING

BYLINE: BY DAILY MAIL REPORTER

LENGTH: 194 words","


RESEARCH has found that more women than men switch from smoking to vaping.

The findings come days after Public Health England concluded that, on the best
estimate so far', e-cigarettes were about 95 per cent less harmful than
traditional tobacco cigarettes.

The official body added that one day e-cigs could be dispensed as a licensed
medicine in an alternative to anti-smoking products such as nicotine patches.

Previously, the e-cigarette market had been dominated by men, but a survey of
36,000 customers in spring 2015 by the vaping brand VIP showed that 53 per cent
of users were female. Although some experts fear that the rise in popularity of
e-cigarettes could glamorise the act of smoking, others believe that it could
hold the key to helping to reduce smoking-related illnesses for future
generations.

According to the Statistics on Smoking 2015, an estimated 2.1 million adults in
Britain use e-cigarettes. Of those, 1.3 million use both tobacco and electronic
cigarettes. The key users are smokers and ex-smokers.

Only 0.14 per cent of users are non-smokers, according to the Opinions and
Lifestyle Survey from the Office for National Statistics.

IF BUREAUCRATIC BUTTINSKIES BACK OFF, E-CIGARETTES CAN HELP SMOKERS QUIT

BYLINE: Amy Ridenour

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A-8

LENGTH: 635 words","


On Jan. 11, 1964, the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health
released its very first report on tobacco smoking.

Based on scientific evidence consisting of over 7,000 articles relating to
smoking and disease, the report cited tobacco smoking as a major cause of lung
and laryngeal cancer and chronic bronchitis.

The report launched a ""war on smoking"" that soon required health warnings on
cigarette packages and bans on broadcast cigarette commercials, and by recent
years had led to bans on smoking in certain areas, with numerous laws and
regulations in between.

Over this half-century of cigarette regulation, two facts have been impressed
upon the nation: 1) smoking tobacco kills people; 2) once a person is addicted
to smoking cigarettes, or, rather, to the nicotine one ingests by smoking
cigarettes, it is very hard for a person to quit.

So when an invention came along - e-cigarettes - that supply nicotine in much
the same way as a tobacco cigarette, but without any apparent link to cancer or
lung disease, there were many cheers.

Finally there was a product that could help those who were addicted and for whom
the available anti-smoking aids had not been of sufficient help.

Lives could be saved. People could replace their tobacco cigarettes with
e-cigarettes; switch out smoke and carcinogens with water vapor and the horrible
smell with no smell at all - or the light scent of a chosen flavor, such as mint
or strawberry.

Lives could be saved.

One would expect the response of the public health community to be a
near-universal ""hurrah"" - and in some quarters, it has been.

But for those who appear to be addicted to regulation, and not to public health,
e-cigarettes provide an unwelcome challenge.

How do they go about banning access to a product that saves lives? And what do
they say when people, quite reasonably, ask, ""why do you want to""?

For many of these regulators, the answer is as ""what if."" ""What if"" vaping -
inhaling water vapor through an e-cigarette - turns out to be harmful? ""What if""
people who vape decide to start smoking, because they first vaped?

It is on the basis of these ""what ifs"" - however unlikely - that some support
bans on the sale of e-cigarettes, or grossly high taxes on e-cigarettes, or
outright bans on the use of e-cigarettes in public.

But such policies mean nicotine addicts will be less likely to use e-cigarettes,
and relatively more likely to keep smoking tobacco. The obvious and predictable
result is relatively more tobacco smoking and thus, more illness and death.

The director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, Mitch Zeller, J.D., made
the key point clear in an interview with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's
New Public Health: ""People are smoking for the nicotine, but dying from the
tar.""

He says e-cigarette regulation should take into account the ""continuum of risk:
that there are different nicotine-containing and nicotine-delivering products
that pose different levels of risk to the individual,"" and regulate accordingly.

Which means America should not treat e-cigarettes and vaping just like tobacco
smoking, because smoking is far more dangerous than vaping.

In fact, because vaping can cause people to voluntarily stop smoking, a
carefully-crafted regulatory policy that steers Americans from smoking toward
vaping as a replacement provides ""an extraordinary public health opportunity.""

Mitch Zeller makes a lot of sense. By contrast, regulation zealots, such as
those in Michigan who in January lobbied against a state-level bill banning the
sale of e-cigarettes to minors because it did not treat e-cigarettes the same as
the far, far more dangerous tobacco cigarettes, are an enemy of public health.

Smoking kills. Vaping is a safer alternative, and our nation's regulatory policy
will save lives if it reflects this fact.

Oregon: Multnomah County moves to ban e-cigarette sales and use by minors, and
in workplaces

LENGTH: 364  words","

DATELINE: Salem


Multnomah County of Oregon has issued the following news release:

The Multnomah County Board of Commissioners on Thursday took the first step
toward prohibiting the sale, use and possession of e-cigarettes by minors, and
barring vaping in the workplace.

In a 5-0 vote, commissioners, acting as the Board of Health, adopted a policy to
prohibit vaping and other inhalant delivery systems in any place of employment
where smoking is already prohibited. The order also bans sales to, and use and
possession by, people under age 18.

Commissioners will take final action March 5 on the ordinance to implement the
Board of Health order. The new law could take effect 30 days after the final
vote.

Chair Deborah Kafoury said that eight years ago, e-cigarettes were not even sold
in the United States. Today, vaping is a common sight across the country.

""The complete lack of regulation and education about all these products that has
made for a lot of confusion. Today, we will bring some clarity to this issue, ''
Kafoury said.

The board's actions came after three briefings and four public hearings on the
dramatic increase in vaping and, e-cigarette use. Use among Oregon's 11th
graders has tripled and one in 10 Multnomah County high school students has
tried inhalant delivery systems the Health Department reports. Public health
officials say the unregulated liquid can contain dangerous chemicals and
nicotine, which is highly addictive and is shown to affect teen brains

""People should not vape where they can not smoke. If you are a kid you will not
be allowed to buy or possess e-cigarettes. If you are a store, you will not sell
them to youth,"" Kafoury said.

Community organizations and health professionals have supported the proposed
actions and asked the board to license retailers. Vape shop owners and employees
have supported the ban on sales to minors but asked to be exempted from the
county's Smoke-free Workplace Law so their customers can continue to sample
their products indoors.

ITV set to premier ads showing people smoking e-cigarettes;
Controversial advert showing woman 'vaping' will air for the first time on
Monday after 9pm watershed

BYLINE: Mark Sweney

SECTION: MEDIA

LENGTH: 571 words","


The first TV advert in nearly half a century to feature a person smoking is set
to be broadcast on ITV on Monday night.

The controversial ad, for VIP e-cigarettes, will air after the 9pm watershed
during the first commercial break in ITV's vintage crime drama Grantchester.

It features a woman ""vaping"" - inhaling vapour from an e-cigarette - and has
been allowed on the small screen for the first time following a legal change by
the Advertising Standards Authority.

It is the first TV ad to feature someone who appears to be smoking since
cigarette commercials were banned in 1965. The ban was extended to include ads
for cigars and rolling tobacco in 1991.

""This advert will mark the first time in almost 50 years that TV audiences see
someone exhale what appears to be cigarette smoke on an advert - however, it is
actually vapour from an e-cigarette that they will see,"" said Dave Levin,
co-founder of VIP.

""Vaping has never been shown on a TV advert in the UK before, so this is a first
for the country and I'm sure it will be a real conversation starter.""

E-cigarettes have been allowed to be advertised on TV for some time, however
until now ads have not been allowed to show someone vaping.

The ASA outlined its new e-cigarette marketing rules in October which said that
ads must not be associated with youth culture, feature under-25s, or be likely
to appeal to those under 18 years old.

Ads are also not allowed to encourage non-smokers or non-nicotine product users
to use e-cigarettes.

""Ash is concerned that VIP's ads sexualise and glamorise e-cigarette use and
don't make clear these products are for smokers,"" said Deborah Arnott, chief
exectuive of Ash. ""If these ads conform to new rules then we're concerned the
rules aren't fit for purpose.""

E-cigarettes contain nicotine but not tobacco and have been marketed as a safer
alternative, or to help those looking to quit real cigarettes.

However critics have argued that portraying any kind of smoking is
irresponsible, as it could encourage more people, particularly young people, to
take up the habit.

Two versions of the ad, a 10-second cut and a 20-second cut, which will air over
the next five weeks.

Another advert for the VIP e-cigarette brand was the most complained about of
2013, prompting 937 complaints about its ""overtly sexual tone"".

The ASA ruled the ad, which featured a sultry-looking woman saying ""I want you
to get it out. I want to see it. Feel it. Hold it. Put it in my mouth. I want to
see how great it tastes"" could only air after 11pm.

An estimated 2.1 million people use e-cigarettes in the UK.

EU legislation threatening cross-border curbs on promoting e-cigarettes are due
in May 2016, a move already subject to a legal challenge by the British company
Totally Wicked, but it is not yet clear how these might be implemented in
Britain.

Train firm's vaping ban

LENGTH: 218  words","


Train operator Southern is to ban the use of electronic cigarettes and other
electronic vaping devices from its trains and stations as of  next month.

The company, which runs services in Hastings, Bexhill, Rye and Eastbourne,
becomes part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise in July and says the ban
falls in line with GTR policy.

A spokesperson for Southern said: ""From Sunday July 26, electronic cigarettes
and other electronic vaping' devices will no longer be permitted on Southern and
Gatwick Express trains and at Southern stations.

""On that date, Southern and Gatwick Express become part of the Govia Thameslink
Railway (GTR) franchise.

""GTR already has this policy and we are changing ours to fall into line with the

Although Southeastern, which runs train services between Hastings and London
Charing Cross via Battle, currently has no such ban on e-cigarettes, the company
said it is considering taking similar action.

A spokesperson for the company said: ""While we have not got a ban at the moment,
it's something we are looking into.""

There is currently no law against using e-cigarettes in England.  But people
will be banned from using e-cigarettes in enclosed places such as restaurants
and pubs in Wales, under a new public health law, which is likely to come into
force in 2017.

Ban public vaping

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. IN6

LENGTH: 420 words","


The Ontario government was on the right track with its plan to stiffen the
Smoke-Free Ontario Act and ban the use of e-cigarettes wherever tobacco smoking
isn't allowed starting on Jan. 1.

It would have meant e-cigarette smokers couldn't ""light"" up and blow clouds of
vapour about in workplaces, restaurants, bars, movie theatres and other public
places.

That was a smart move for two reasons. It would prevent people from being
irritated from vapours released by e-cigarette liquids laced with everything
from peppermint to nicotine. And it would have answered concerns that the use of
the devices in public spaces ""normalizes"" smoking behaviour after decades of
public health campaigns dedicated to making it socially unacceptable.

Now, unfortunately, Associate Health Minister Dipika Damerla has postponed the
Jan. 1 ban on vaping in public spaces. She should rethink her decision.

The delay stems from the fact that the government still hasn't resolved whether
or not to allow medical marijuana users to vape or smoke in public spaces. The
minister says she wants to bring in all regulations concerning vaping at the
same time.

That's a bad move. The public space vaping ban, coupled with a ban on the sale
of e-cigs to those under 19 (which is still slated to go ahead on New Year's
Day), had been welcomed by such well-informed groups as the Canadian Cancer
Society, the Ontario Medical Association, the Heart and Stroke Foundation, the
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and Toronto Public Health.

And while the minister says she will move to restrict the places e-cigarettes
can be used ""early in the new year,"" one can only wonder whether she will be
able to fulfill that promise if it hinges on resolving the ultra-controversial
issue of whether medical marijuana users should be able to ""light"" up
e-cigarettes or joints anytime, anywhere.

Indeed, the government's initial acknowledgement in November that it planned to
allow medical marijuana users to smoke or ""vape"" in public spaces was so badly
received that it was withdrawn within a day for further study.

Regardless of the issue of second-hand smoke or vapours from cannabis, no one
knows what the harmful effects of e-cigarettes might be, either to users of the
devices or those exposed to second-hand vapours. Both the provincial and federal
governments are funding research into the health effects.

In the meantime, the ban on vaping in public spaces should not be delayed. It
was the right decision when it was made, and it's still the right thing to do.

BART plans to ban e-cigarettes

Responding to riders complaints, BART plans to join the ranks of public transit
agencies snuffing out e-cigarette use on its trains and at stations.

The Bay Area Rapid Transit board has scheduled a Feb. 12 final vote on the ban,
after giving unanimous initial approval last week.

The American Lung Association called for the measure, saying it is important to
protect the health of riders from secondhand vapors and particle pollution from
electronic cigarettes.

""If someone pulls out one of these devices on a crowded BART train, you're
stuck,"" said Serena Chen, regional advocacy director for the American Lung
Association in California. ""It's not harmless water vapor. They are particles of
nicotine and other substances that are listed as harmful toxics.""

E-cigarettes heat a liquid to produce vapors that can carry nicotine to the user
-- along with a variety of flavored substances. Sales of the devices are booming
as an alternative to tobacco cigarettes.

And complaints about use of the devices on trains also are growing, said BART
Director Robert Raburn of Oakland.

While the district bans smoking, it has had no policy on electronic cigarettes.
Vaping devices would be subject to the same rules as cigarettes.

An e-cigarette industry spokesman said Tuesday the measure overreaches because
it bans vaping devices everywhere on BART property -- not just on train cars.

""As a matter of etiquette, you can see a ban on trains,"" said Greg Conley,
president of the American Vaping Association. ""But the proposal goes too far,
and it's emblematic of the anti-cigarette groups treating electronic cigarettes
the same.""

The vaping association contends e-cigarettes are much safer than tobacco
cigarettes and help many smokers wean themselves off tobacco.

The lung association, however, says many people who have never smoked get hooked
on nicotine through e-cigarettes

At a BART meeting Thursday night, five speakers spoke in favor of the ban.
Penalties would be $100 for first-time violators and $200 for second-time
offenders.

Caltrans, AC Transit, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority and San
Francisco Muni public transit systems already have banned electronic cigarettes,
according to the lung association.

But some other transit operators such as the San Diego Metropolitan Transit
System and the Sacramento Regional Transit District have not restricted
e-cigarettes as they await state and federal guidelines.

A bill introduced this week by state Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, would
classify e-cigarettes as tobacco products and bar them from public transit
systems, the workplace, schools and in restaurants and bars.

E-cigarettes are unattractive to non-smokers and there is no evidence they are a
gateway to smoking, an expert has told Assembly Members.

""At the moment all vaping does is potentially save lives,"" said Professor Peter
Hajek, the co-author of a Public Health England-commissioned report which
advocated the use of the devices to help people quit smoking.

Prof Hajek told AMs he wouldn't support a ban on smoking e-cigarettes indoors
and said not liking something was not a good enough reason to stop it.

He argued there was no risk from ""passive vaping"" like there is with passive
smoking.

The Welsh Government has proposed banning e-cigarettes in enclosed public and
work spaces amid worries they normalise smoking.

But Prof Hajek, from the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, argued
e-cigarettes were not attractive to those who don't already light up and claimed
there were few young people using them who did not already smoke.

""At the moment the evidence we have is that e-cigarettes are remarkably
unattractive to non-smokers,"" he told a meeting of the National Assembly's
Health Committee, which is investigating the Public Health Bill that includes
the ban.

""Nicotine by itself is not that addictive. What is addictive is cigarettes,"" he
said.

He suggested non-smokers may try e-cigarettes and added: ""That is happening
increasingly but rather remarkably they don't progress to daily use.""

He also claimed it was ""almost impossible to find a young non-smoker who would
be a daily vaper"".

""We have data year after year that more and more smokers believe that
e-cigarettes are harmful. That puts them off doing something which would save
their lives,"" he said.

Prof Hajek said he did not have a strong feeling about the proposed Welsh ban
but added: ""On balance I think I would vote against such a regulation.

Prof Hajek's report said e-cigarettes could help reduce smoking-related diseases
and deaths if smokers, who cannot or do not want to stop smoking, were

""The recent report published by Public Health England clearly demonstrates that

'Vapers' dispute e-cigarette health concerns; Evidence of risks mount, report
says

BYLINE: Brian Cross, The Windsor Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 858 words","


When dedicated users of ecigarettes gather once a month for a ""vape meet,"" a
corner of Villians Beastro resembles a smoke-filled bar from before the days of
tobacco bans.

""Until the government starts issuing bans, we're going to be a vape-friendly
bar,"" Villians owner and vaper Geoff Zanetti said recently as he described the
growing popularity of ecigarettes, battery-operated devices that use an atomizer
to heat a liquid solution to produce a vapour that looks like cigarette smoke.

""It's a really good alternative,"" for people hooked on tobacco, he said. But
there's a move afoot by health officials to ban e-cigarettes wherever tobacco
products are banned, such as restaurants, bars and workplaces.

Toronto's medical officer of health Dr. David McKeown recently produced a report
that called e-cigarette use a public health concern because: there is ""emerging
evidence"" of health risks associated with vaping and second-hand exposure to
vapour; young people who start with vaping could end up nicotine addicted and
graduate to cigarettes; and vaping in public places would counter the
longstanding efforts to ""denormalize all smoking behaviour.""

Zanetti and other vapers say they've seen many longtime smokers switch to
e-cigarettes, which can supply nicotine as well as the social interaction that
smokers miss when they quit.

""I don't see a harm in it, it doesn't affect anybody,"" said Zanetti.
""Second-hand vape? I think the government just needs to relax on things like
that.""

Earlier this week, the Toronto Star reported that Ontario Health Minister Eric
Hoskins was gathering new information on e-cigarettes. Hoskins said ""there may
be measures that need to be taken by the province, but I'm not going to
prejudge.""

Responding to McKeown's report that urges Toronto to enact a ban on e-cigarettes
- treating them the same as tobacco - if Ontario doesn't do something within six
months, the health minister said: ""February is a long ways away.""

Mike Hart, who operates an online and retail operation called Vape Me Vapables
in Windsor, called what's happening in Toronto shameful.

""I was under the impression something had to be proven dangerous before it could
be banned,"" he wrote in an email that disputed McKeown's arguments. Vaping and
smoking tobacco may look similar but there's no combustion with vaping, he said.
And the e-juice he sells to produce the vapour has only four ingredients:
nicotine, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and baking flavourings.

""The functional and visual similarity is what makes (e-cigarettes) so effective
at quitting combustion. It's an an upgrade from smoking.""

The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit has not devised its own position on
e-cigarettes, but director of health promotion Nicole Dupuis said Dr. McKeown's
report lays out the public health concerns. Health Canada has advised people not
to use them because there has not been enough research to determine if they're
safe or unsafe.

E-cigarettes were developed in China starting around 2004 and came to North
America in 2007, and they've been growing in popularity ever since. But while
many people use them to help quit smoking, their effectiveness has not been
proven, McKeown's report says. He suggests that the use of e-cigarettes in
places where smoking is banned could undermine smoking bans and quit attempts,
""and serve as a gateway to nicotine addiction or smoking initiation among
youth.""

He also said there is a growing body of scientific evidence that the vapour,
including second-hand vapour, poses a health risk. As well, studies have
detected ultrafine metal particles in the vapour that possibly come from
e-cigarette heating elements. Other studies have identified negative health
outcomes, such as mouth and throat irritation, decreased lung function, allergic
reactions and potential lung inflammation.

The report also says that because vapour looks like cigarette smoke, ecigarette
use in public places makes it difficult to enforce smoking bans, can trigger
people trying to quit smoking to re-start, and contributes to the ""social
visibility of smoking in public places,"" which makes smoking seem more
acceptable, particularly to youth.

""Restrictions on e-cigarette use in public places are necessary to ensure that
children and youth are exposed to smoke-free role models,"" the report says.

But Paul Dinunzio, a former smoker for 30 years who quit when he started vaping
three years ago, said e-cigarettes may not be perfect but they sure beat the
alternative. He said because vaping retains that hand-tomouth motion and the
social aspects of smoking, it helped him quit smoking.

""When you inhale it, it feels like you're inhaling smoke,"" said Dinunzio, who
started up a vaping shop called Vaporama in Amherstburg six months ago. The
e-liquid he sells does have a small amount of nicotine, ""so you're not getting
that nicotine craving,"" he said.

""I personally think that the government would be better off in the long run to
let this go and grow, because they would save in health costs. Every person who
gets off cigarettes is going to save them a ton in health costs later in life.""

I SPOTTED this sign on the front door of Eddie Rocket's and wonder is this the
sign of things to come.

We all know smoking has been banned in a lot of locations for years now, but
vaping has proved a bit more of a new debate.

I have to say, I think Eddie Rocket's are right and this could be the start of a
trend.

I wonder where legislation stands on this and it is a case of each premises
simply putting up a sign.

One thing is certain, the signmakers will have a new product to add to their
list.

The vaping craze has become huge and I see shops popping up all over the place.

It remains to be seen what the future holds for the vapour retailers and will it
eventually become the new smoking?

Lighting up in public

SECTION: C; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 918 words","


It was trivia night, and Michael Jamnick didn't want to leave the TGI Friday's
in Maple Grove, Minn., to go outside and have a smoke. So he started puffing
right where he sat.

The 27-year-old from Minnetonka wasn't breaking the law: He was using an
electronic cigarette.

Still, Jamnick said he felt uncomfortable vaping (the e-cigarette term for
lighting up).

""It's been, what, six years now since they passed the smoking ban in Minnesota?""
he said. ""You give it a funny look because you haven't seen it in a while.""

Electronic cigarettes have been on a slow burn for years, but they've recently
caught fire. National sales jumped to $500 million in 2012 and are projected to
clear $1 billion this year.

The e-cigarette industry is promoting vaping as a hip, healthier alternative to
smoking - and as a way to quit. But while health experts largely agree that the
vapour from e-cigarettes poses less of a threat to public health than tobacco
cigarettes, some worry that welcoming the so-called ""clean nicotine"" could erode
smoking bans, encourage smokers to trade one addiction for another and hook
non-smokers.

""Shifting entirely over to vaping from smoking would be a big public-health
plus,"" said Robert Proctor, a history-of-science professor at Stanford
University. ""But the question of whether e-cigarettes are good or bad isn't that
simple.""

E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that create a vapour mist from a heated
liquid solution when the user inhales on a mouthpiece. The solution, or
""e-juice,"" and vapour mist, which looks like smoke, typically contain nicotine,
but users can regulate the amount. That's why some vapers say e-cigarettes have
helped them quit tobacco - and wean themselves off nicotine altogether.

Research released in late June by Italy's University of Catania lends support to
those claims. The study found that 13 per cent of participants who used
high-dose e-cigarettes quit smoking. Seventy per cent of those who quit smoking
eventually gave up e-cigarettes, too.

""As evidenced in this study, when people switch to electronic cigarettes, it
absolutely makes it easier to quit nicotine use completely,"" said Michael
Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health who studies
e-cigarettes. ""It's not as simple as saying people are substituting one
addiction for another.""

In fact, Siegel said, the quit rate for e-cigarettes is comparable to rates in
other nicotine-replacement-therapy studies.

But others maintain that it's not yet known how harmful vaping could be.

""We frankly don't know much about them,"" said Robert Moffitt, an American Lung
Association media relations director.

Concerns about harm from secondhand vapour are not at the forefront. While a
2012 German study found that the vapour is an ""aerosol of ultra-fine particles,""
no studies have shown it to be dangerous. But Moffitt and others question claims
that e-cigarettes can help smokers quit.

""We'd strongly recommend anyone (against) using them,"" he said, ""especially with
so many other valid smoking-cessation devices and techniques that we know work.""

He also doubts that the e-cigarette industry, which includes big tobacco
companies, would encourage people to stop using nicotine entirely.

""They're looking for new young people to get hooked on nicotine products,"" he
said, ""and e-cigarettes seem to be the latest.""

Stanford's Proctor, however, sees both the promise and the threat in the recent
rapid spread of e-cigarettes.

""E-cigs seem to offer us the possibility of keeping the addiction, while losing
the cancer,"" he said. ""But is addiction itself a bad thing? That question is
splitting the public-health community, and it's not yet clear which direction
we'll go.""

Michael ""Troop"" Wolberg, 41, used to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day. After
trying to quit several times, he turned to e-cigarettes. On his third day of
vaping, the Stacy, Minn., man says he lit his last cigarette. Since then, he's
become a champion of e-cigarettes. He's written online reviews of vaping
products, become a member of the Minnesota Vapers Club and helps run an online
business that sells flavoured e-juice.

Wolberg, who calls himself an advocate of ""tobacco harm reduction,"" isn't shy
about using his e-cigarette.

""I'm rather proud to display it in public because I think it needs to be seen,""
he said.

Cynthia Hallett couldn't disagree more. Hallett, executive director of Americans
for Nonsmokers' Rights, says vaping could undermine the hard-won battles to
establish non-smoking areas.

Proctor echoes her concerns.

""If you can't tell whether someone is vaping or smoking, that could work to
erode established no-smoking zones,"" he said.

So far, e-cigarettes aren't widely regulated.

In 2012, Minnesota passed a law banning the sale of e-cigarettes to minors. But,
in part because e-cigarettes don't burn anything, they haven't been legally
prohibited in public places.

However, the electronic cigarettes have been banned in public schools through
Grade 12 schools in the state and some colleges and universities also have moved
to ban them.

The Lung Association's Moffitt hopes legal measures will be taken to ban
e-cigarettes in public places before they become more common.

""Maybe we need to put the kibosh on these right now,"" he said.

For now, using e-cigarettes may come down to common courtesy.

Jamnick, who has quit smoking cigarettes, doubts he'll use his e-cigarette much
anymore when he's out.

""Generally, I try to avoid using it around other people,"" he said, ""because some
people just don't like it.""

BART plans to ban e-cigarettes

Responding to riders complaints, BART plans to join the ranks of public transit
agencies snuffing out e-cigarette use on its trains and stations.

The Bay Area Rapid Transit Board board has scheduled a Feb. 12 final vote on the
ban, after giving unanimous initial approval last week.

The American Lung Association called for the measure, saying it is important to
protect the health of riders from second-hand vapors and particle pollution from
electronic cigarettes.

""If someone pulls out one of this devices on a crowded BART train, you're
stuck,"" said Serena Chen, regional advocacy director for the American Lung
Association in California. ""It's not harmless water vapor. They are particles of
nicotine and other substances that are listed as harmful toxics.""

E-cigarettes heat a liquid to produce vapors that can carry nicotine to the user
-- along with a variety of flavored substances. Sales of the devices are booming
as an alternative to tobacco cigarettes.

And complaints about use of the devices on trains also are growing, said BART
Director Robert Raburn of Oakland.

While the district bans smoking, it has had no policy on electronic cigarettes.
Vaping devises would be subject to the same rules as cigarettes.

An e-cigarette industry spokesman said Tuesday the measure overreaches because
it bans vaping devices everywhere on BART property -- not just on train cars.

""As a matter of etiquette, you can see a ban on trains,"" said Greg Conley,
president of the American Vaping Association. ""But the proposal goes too far and
it's emblematic of the anti-cigarette groups treating electronic cigarettes the
same.""

The vaping association contends e-cigarettes are much safer than tobacco
cigarettes and help many smokers wean themselves off tobacco.

The lung association, however, says many people who have never smoked get hooked
on nicotine through e-cigarettes

At a BART meeting Thursday night, five speakers spoke in favor of the ban.

Penalties would be $100 for first-time violators and $200 for second time
offenders.

Caltrans, AC Transit, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority and San
Francisco Muni public transit systems already have banned electronic cigarettes,
says the American Lung Association.

But some other transit operators such as the San Diego Metropolitan Transit
System have not restricted e-cigarettes as they await state and federal
guidelines.

A bill introduced this week by State Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, would
classify e-cigarettes as tobacco products and bar them from public transit
systems, the work place, schools, and in restaurants and bars.

GRAPHIC: FILE - In this Feb. 20, 2014 file photo, a man exhales vapor from an
e-cigarette in New York. Using certain electronic cigarettes at high temperature
settings could release much more formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical, than
smoking traditional cigarettes does, lab tests suggest. The research published
in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2015 is not proof
of a risk - it involved limited testing on just one brand of e-cigarettes. But
scientists say it shows how little is known about the safety of these popular
devices. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)
