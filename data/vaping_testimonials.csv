0,"I quit a 20 year habit of smoking tobacco cigarettes the day my first quality starter kit arrived. Unlike the many failed attempts at quitting and wasting tons of money in the past using the usual over the counter quit smoking products such as the patch and gum that are in my opinion just a way to keep people hooked on smoking vaping worked for me immediately. Not only did I quit smoking immediately it made it very easy for me to do as well. I was already feeling better within the first week and things have just kept getting better and better for me. I also got off using a bronchial inhaler because I could breathe so much better and no longer do I get feelings of having asthma attacks regularly. It has been over 6 years now since I started vaping and because vaping allowed me to quit smoking cigarettes it has made my life so much better in so many ways in which I am very grateful. It really enrages me to think there are groups out there that want to take away something from people that is clearly helping millions upon millions around the world to end a deadly habit and I want to do everything I can to make sure that never happens. BTW I’m 46 years old and I love the candy flavors, the bakery flavors and all the other things supposedly only kids are suppose to like and do not care for any of the tobacco flavors at all. I really wish people in general against these types of flavors and who create such ridiculous lies and false assumptions about them using “The Children” as an aid to fight vaping would stop insulting the intelligence of the people of the world about this topic. The fact is whether you a baby or over 100 years old and can still taste age has nothng to do with what tastes good to an individual but it is a majot part of what keeps people from going back to smoking. That is why they want flavor restrictions so less people are successful when quitting smoking thast turn to vaping. Long Live Vaping!

1,"Started when I was 13 years old, now 55. Tried to quit many times, nicotine patches, gum, cold turkey, never managed more then a few days. It’s only been 3 weeks since I started vaping but I have not had a cigarette since. I started out a low nicotine level, 6%, and it seems to be the right level for me. 3 weeks for me is amazing, I have no cravings. Vaping is working for me and quite a number of people at my place of employment. Physically I haven’t noticed a difference, early days yet.

3,"I smoked for over 16 year, one pack a day if not more. Just in September 2015 I walked into a Vape shop and asked what was the best device to help me to quit the cigarettes. From that day one, I haven’t touched one. Being a fire fighter, I came to work and it caught the interest of a couple other fireman who smoked or used other forms of tobacco and were sick of it. By this time I had an assortment of mods and tanks, and was able to sell it to them and the have since quit. I’m glad to hear that three others have quit smoking due to my fireman showing their personal friends what vaping has done for them and saved their lives as well.
I have tried some many times to quit, and there were always reasons to start. Going to Iraq, deploying agin while I was in the military, and just being a firefighter. I’ve tried the gas station “e-cigs” and really wanted it to work but I through them out the window. Vaping is here, it has saved countless lives! This country should except it vaping just as it is, a life saver, and promote with advertisements instead of these ads that scare our children showing the sad, unfortunate life of former smokers.

I made many attempts to quit during that time. I used the nicotine patch, the nicotine gum, the nicotine lozenge, hypnosis and will power. On December 17, 2010 I purchased an electronic cigarette and I have been a non smoker since that very first puff. My health has improved as well. I no longer suffer from sinus infections, ear infections or the constant chest congestion I became used to having. I can climb many flights of stairs without getting winded as well. I believe if it were not for the electronic cigarette, I would have been a smoker for the rest of my life. I have seen 100’s of people in my own community and through the L.A.

I always said that people will know when I quit smoking because didn’t want to advertised it. 20 years later after my retirement it was very hard for me to quit. Over 30 years has passed and I was in the same boat, smoking a pack a day and sometimes more. One day My Son Carlos arrived home with a Mechanical Mod, I tried the device, the flavor the vapor and the beauty of the device got my attention. I started researching everything about Vaping. Wow a lot of good information out there; I also researched any side effects and so far nothing solid comparing. Well my friends thanks to My Son who introduced me into Vaping, I have a new hobby and have been smoke free for over five month. I can Vape in my car; I can Vape around my friend without the nasty smell of combustion cigarettes. I’m running 6 to 10miles a day I used to sleep 3 to 4 hours after working 18, now I’m sleeping 6 and 7, no more chest pain or out of breath. Vaping is the future and the future is Now.

10,"I have been smoking cigarettes from the early age of 12 years old. I have done other non-legal drugs in the past and quit cold turkey with no thoughts of going back. My cigarette habit unfortunately has not been so easy. My first time trying to quit on my own not only failed but when I went back to smoking I ended up smoking even more. A few years later I tried again. This time using the nic gum. Again it didn’t work. In fact I went through a terrible time and actually tried to O.D. by putting about 20 patches on at the same time and chewing a whole case of the nic gum. It made me really sick but still I soon after moved to smoking 2 packs a day. Quitting smoking has been the single hardest thing I have done in my life. I tried the disposable cigarette shaped e-cigs at the gas station and they just didnt work for me. I learned about vaping from a coworker and soon bought my own vape pen mod. After about a week I’ve not had any urge to smoke cigarettes, in fact, when someone walks by me and smells like cigarettes it makes me sick. My very first juice I used was menthol tobacco flavor to help ease the transition. I have since only used fruity flavored juice as the tobacco juice smell also makes me sick. The different flavors have helped. It’s like having a ham and cheese sandwich to eat everyday for months… you get sick of eating ham and cheese. The different flavors are to help keep people from getting sick of the same flavor and giving up on it. If vaping goes away from these laws I will loose what little respect for this government I have left.

We tried the blue cigarettes and they were terrible. 2 months ago, my husband and I walked into our 1st vapor store. Had it not been for the informed workers and the ability to try all the flavors, I do not think that we would be where we are now…2 months of not smoking and our nicotine level is almost to “0” on the vapor. Switching and decreasing nicotine has been one of the easiest things either of us have ever done. I am very upset that our government is now trying to squash this. Anyone that switches to these can quit…just ask my husband. It is a bunch of B.S. That there is no proof that people have actually quit using this product. Also, I know how I used to feel when I smoked…tired…out of breathe and my skin looked gray.,.. No longer!

19,"I am a consumer of electronic cigarettes aka vaper, a primary stakeholder in this process. Regulations have advantages and then the negatives. These particular regulations will cause me actual financial, physical and personal harm. Physically in 1998 I was diagnosed with COPD I tried every available method to quit smoking. Not one worked I still continued to smoke. Since July 26th 2013 I have made the switch to vaping.
My COPD diagnosis is GONE My Pulmonary Doctor is THRILLED – yes GONE. He even tells other patients about this great alternative! My Primary Care Physician is amazed at my results of routine blood work.
My Cardiologist is thrilled, I no longer have Angina pectoris or spasms, no need to carry Nitroglycerine pills which lowered my medical prescriptions, a financial benefit. No more restriction in my lungs. I no longer get Bronchitus, sinus infections etc again less medical costs (Dr Appts and Rx’s)I breathe better, feel better, smell better and can go on walks with my dog, SCUBA Diving which I used to teach I had to give up. Now I can recreational Dive without having to come to the surface sooner due to better air consumption and so many more things that keep my active and healthy!Financially the cost alone has major benefits!! We live on a fixed income. Almost 30% of our monthly funds were going towards tobacco cigarettes. I tried so hard to cut down, cut back etc. ironically that only made me more anxious and want more. Now we have funds available for MUCH more pleasurable things to do. I eat better because food tastes better. I smell better I’m sure you get the idea now – even my vehicle smells better. Only one negative, I can now smell hand tobacco smoke from quite some distance and I am embarrassed to think I subjected family, friends and by-standers to that.I started smoked tobacco cigarettes over 39 YEARS ago (almost HALF my life!). I have tried time and time again to quit. Using everything from HRT produces patches, gum and rx meds (Buproprion, Nicotrol I had an allergic reactions. Chantix which was even worse Anaphylactic shock, which even after only 1 pill I still suffered nightmares, cold sweats and suicidal thought. If it was out there I tried it even to the extent of Acupuncture and Hypnosis. All failed for one reason or another. Enter early July 2013 .. I had picked up a cig-alike at a gas station was not great but gave me enough to make me do a LOT of research. Mainly on-line sites. Abundance of educational sites for new consumers to make the right choices. I was very lucky and made friends who helped me make the right choices as far as my first kit. I will say that even though I was a Menthol Tobacco smoker. I can not stand any menthol tobacco flavored e-liquid. Ironically Coffee flavored e-liquid was my first try I said ! YES THIS WILL DO IT !!? It DID!
I will celebrate my two year tobacco free. Due to quality flavors. Yes I use a Baked Cinnamon Roll, Strawberry Milk, Blue Raspberry, Blueberry fruits, Butterscotch candy flavors I like sweets, but the e-liquids do not give me weight gain. It’s wonderful to have the flavors without the calories! Had I been left to gas station type cig-alikes I would never have been able to quit. I don’t like any type of tobacco flavorings at ALL especially menthol tobacco. I use an atomizer, e-liquid and rechargeable batteries. If these products are no longer available to me. I sincerely fear I would truly have a hard time not going back to using tobacco products – which honestly I am truly afraid for my own overall health, well being and finances.Products such as Blu, Green Smoke etc are not satisfying. Over the course of the past year I have been successful in reducing the amount of nicotine I use additionally I have also lowered the amount of e-liquid used on a daily basis.This has been a fantastic, successful year for not only myself, but my Husband. He has been able to quit tobacco entirely. Vaping exclusively.
The good that this product does. I would never have believed this could work for me. Not only has it done exactly that – but I have over 34 friends who have also entirely quit smoking tobacco and use e-liquids, atomizers and rechargeable batteries with continued success.
My e-liquids are stored in safe places even though there are no children in my house, we do have pets that are just like children to us.

24,"This turned into a bit of a novel after reading back through it. For that I apologize, but I hope you enjoy. I’m 24 years old, and being that even before I was old enough to buy a pack of cigarettes (16-17 years old) I was smoking, I was on the road a lot, after finishing school, “chasing the dream” as a musician and more often than not our method of curbing a hungry stomach was to smoke, we ate when we could, but the smokes we our main focus. The most I had ever gotten up to was a pack a day. I got to the point that I was having issues breathing, really bad issues, I was getting out of breath going from one side of some of the smallest stages to the other, I couldn’t keep enough air in my lungs to sing half of what I was supposed to be singing, and that just not good at all. I coughed all of the time, and it just became socially awkward for me to be out with friends who didn’t smoke when I’d have to walk outside of where ever we were so that I could smoke and come back, then later in the evening repeat the process, normally more than just once. Quitting came for me in the form of cold turkey more times than I can remember, patches, gum, and even the blu e-cigs. I never really tried any of the prescription meds out there that supposedly were supposed to help, but everyone to whom I spoke about them were still smokers, so my mind was made up on that one very easily. No matter what I tried I never ended up quitting and I just remained a smoker. So, one day I was out and I got curious, I went into a vape shop, I didn’t have any intentions of quitting at that point, I just wanted to check it out because I’d seen the shops popping up a little bit of everywhere. I was greeted in the pleasant manner any employee at any retail shop would greet someone. He asked me if there was anything he could help me with and I just kind of said, “not really I just wanted to check this place out, since I’ve never been in a vape shop before.” Talking to the guy behind the counter, who even mentioned me flipping out my cig before walking in, he convinced me that vaping was something that I may be interested in checking out and learning about, so we set up in a spot at the end of the counter and he convinced me to come back the next day and buy a basic drip set up. He was a great salesman. I got my set up and figured that since I just dropped a pretty penny on this I should actually be serious and try to quit using vaping as my method. I started off vaping when I could, in the beginning it was a challenge for me, I was an hour into it and set up like a cloud chaser… I hit the fire button: I coughed… I hacked… I gagged… I realized that I needed to ease my way into this. So I vaped occasionally, and I’d still smoke a cigarette every now and then until I could just completely phase them out. I used really sweet, fruity flavors in the beginning, I still do occasionally, but right now I’m vaping on Coval’s Chocolate Doughnut. I started off at 12 mg of nicotine, and I’m down to just 3 mg, I’ve stayed steady where I’m at. I haven’t smoked a cigarette since a week after I first started vaping. I can barely stand the smell of cigarettes, let alone the taste, I took a hit from one that I found in my car and couldn’t do it, I wanted to vomit. Vaping has seriously helped me quit smoking, and I couldn’t be happier, nor could my family.

Closed-system devices didn’t cut it for me.

27,"In 2010 I was smoking 3 packs a day plus 3-10 cigars on any given day. I had severe uncontrolled Asthma, had just been diagnosed with having COPD and was pretty much unable to walk my dog or go up stairs without gasping for air. I had been smoking for 37 years. Wanted to stop but simply couldn’t with the available products on the market. I saw a friend using a device that looked like a box of some kind and so I asked about this device. It turned out to be one of the early “box mods” and he told me he had quit smoking in short order using this device. He suggested I also try to quit.
I ordered an eGo kit hopeful but not sure it would work. I also ordered a tasty fruity e-juice to use with the device
I thought if I could at least cut down on the amount I smoked I’d be happy right?
I got the kit in and it was quite different from smoking but it felt the same which is why it does work I believe.
Imagine my surprise when I found on the third day I could not stomach the taste ,smell or stink of a combustible cigarette!
In just those 3 days I only had one cigarette per day while using the vaporizer to quit. I substituted using the ecig every time I wanted a cigarette without any ill effects in regards to nicotine or smoking.
By the third day I had NO desire to smoke at all! ZERO!
My PCP tested me right before I quit smoking and my lung function was .2 which is horrible. After I had been quit a couple months we did another one and I had an almost perfect score at .24! She was amazed that I had been able to quit after all the methods we tried and failed with including every FDA approved drug and other methods. I had at least 15 cycles of quitting and failing utterly.
I am so grateful for discovering vapor products!
I would urge those wanting to ban these life saving devices to tread very lightly and stop being led by the CDC and WHO.
Over regulation will kill this industry and send us all back to smoking if we cannot get the products we believe we need.

Never really gave it a second thought as far as my health was concerned. As I became older and more concerned about my health, I spent YEARS trying EVERYTHING on the market to quit smoking and NOTHING worked.

My doctors told me that unless I quit smoking and lost weight I probably wouldn’t live to be 50 years of age. This was one month prior to my 40th birthday. So now, not only did I want to quit smoking, I HAD TO QUIT!!! As previously stated, I had already tried EVERYTHING on the market to no success, then I found e-cigarettes. I ordered a kit and the VERY FIRST DAY I started using it I never touched another cigarette. VAPING SAVED MY LIFE!!! I had Gastric Bypass surgery, lost 200 lbs, quit smoking,had a few more back surgeries and now my doctors tell me that I can look forward to a long healthy life. I am in the best health I have been in since before I started smoking and my children are happy that I will be around for a long time. I AM PROOF THAT VAPING WORKS AND IS A HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE TO SMOKING!!!!! I would even show my health records and just by looking at those you can see EXACTLY when I started vaping. I got off of cigs all because of vaping and I didn’t even use tobacco flavors, I vape fruit flavors or mint or caramel or whatever flavor I crave that day. Vaping even helped with my weight loss because instead of eating sweets, I can have a sweet flavored vape and curb that craving. I can honestly say that Vaping saved my life!!!",Vaping worked for me when NOTHING else did…,http://vaping.info/news/2015/vaping-worked-nothing-else

I wasnt even able to quit during my pregnancies, I did cut back a significant amount but I could never fully quit. After trying everything from medication to the patch, I looked into vaping.

Not one to go to the emergency room for the third time that week, my wife could started raping about two weeks prior using a Joye 510 e-cigarette with a menthol cartridge with 24 nicotine, I asked her if it was similar to a regular cigarette her response was no it was totally different, why it asked this question I’d never smoked, so I asked her how she uses it and I took a drawl off of it, but in cough right away, so took another longer drawl into my lungs even I was having trouble with my asthma handed it back to her about 3 to 4 minutes later I started coughing, as I was coughing a cop the wheeze that I had in my lungs causing me troubled to breathe since I was out of my rescue inhaler to help me I was good for the rest the night until I could go to the pharmacy to get me a new inhaler, about a month later withdrawn to a flea market and for some unknown reason I left my inhaler in the car and began to have trouble breathing again with my asthma, the wife jokingly asked me do I want to take a drag offer e-cigarette, thinking back to what happened, I said sure took a couple drags nothing really happened is was walking a few minutes later a started coughing again, again I’d coughed the wheeze out and felt a lot better and spent the next few hours walking around the flea market. As was going home we started talking the following week I picked me up a e-cigarette kit for myself because I didn’t mind doing wasn’t because I thought I was cool or that I’d fit in with the in crowd but I can tell that when I was using it I felt better. As time went on I noticed I wasn’t using the inhaler or my nebulizer machine and I wasn’t going to the are I’ve not used in inhaler in a little over five years also have not been to the ER for an asthma attack, please don’t think that because you have asthma this will work for you, it just happened to help me out with my breathing, I always keep a small bottle of menthol flavor around in case I feel little wheeze in my chest but other than that I use different flavored E juices and have had no bad effects from I will say I have dropped from the 24 nicotine to where I’m only using zero to 6 mg of nicotine in my vapor. This is my story baking is help me with my breathing, and I’ve seen it change my wife who was diagnosed with first stage COPD and last month when she had a checkup the doctor said that she didn’t have COPD anymore, is this because she quit smoking and went to vaping I don’t know, I’m just hoping to have her around longer because she is not smoking.",Why BigMoose vapes,http://vaping.info/news/2015/bigmoose-vapes
31,"I began smoking at age 14. I started trying to quit at 25. I am now 56. I tried gum, patches, snuff, various pills, cold turkey, and other methods. Nothing worked. In 2009, six years ago this May, I got my first ecig. I threw away my cigarettes the next day, and never bought another. Since then, I only accept a smoke socially, on the rare occasion I am surrounded by smokers (I call it ‘smoking in self defense’), but for all purposes of health and well-being I have quit. I started vaping 36% tobacco flavored nicotine liquid and over a number of months turned it down to where I am now, 3%. I almost immediately switched to a mild fruit flavor, which made the experience so much more pleasant than cigarettes that smoking began to disgust me, even in others. I am very careful to buy my liquid from reputable suppliers, always looking for those who test and disclose ingredients. My doctor, who has continually advised me to quit smoking, is very pleased, and encourages me to continue using the ecig. I can walk and exercise without running out of breath, even at 7000 feet. I don’t cough or wheeze any more and I almost never get sick. My home, car, and clothing smell good. I am happy that I can taste my food, and slightly less happy that I can smell all sorts of odors around me, of which I was previously unaware. My family is no longer exposed to my second-hand smoke. My non-smoking friends are thrilled, and welcome the tiny trace of fruit scent they can catch, occasionally and briefly, in the air around me. My smoking friends are dwindling: I can think offhand of eight people close to me who tried for years to quit smoking, and only succeeded when ecigs became available. I am sure that I have extended my life, but even more important, so grateful that its quality has improved in so many ways. All of this knowledge makes it frustrating and upsetting to hear the misinformation coming from the government and the media; my observations and experiences convince me thoroughly enough that I am willing to promise you that, when the results are in, they will show that ecigarettes extend and dramatically improve the lives of addicted smokers and those around them.","After 35 years, I have quit.",http://vaping.info/news/2015/35-years-quit

I was a smoker for over 30 years and at 45 years old after trying everything from willpower to all of the patches and pills I finally quit smoking. For the last 5 or 6 years I was up to 3 packs a day and over 2 packs a day for most of the previous years. With vaping it took only 3 days for me to stop buying smokes. I have been smoke free for over 2 months and in that time my cough has subsided and my energy level has VASTLY improved to the point that my managers at work have noticed.

While I never tried anything else but cold turkey, I can tell you this was more effective than any other attempt that I had made.

I’d had 2 heart attacks and lost my Father when he was 53 to a massive heart attack (3pk a day), my Sister when she was 58 (2 pk a day) and other close family members to smoking related illnesses. Like most people, I had tried the nicotine gum, patches, cold turkey etc., etc. to no avail. My wife told me about some of the women at work who had started vaping. I thought, this will never work for me, they probably only smoke a few cigs a day. Surely it couldn’t work for a 2pk a day smoker like myself! A few days later I stopped by a local vapor shop to check it out. The fellow was very friendly and patiently listened to my story. He answered all my questions and set me up with a Starter Kit and some juice. Still skeptical, I used my new device the rest of the day without another cigarette.

38,"I’m 29 years old. I had been smoking for 14 years of my life. Up until two months ago, I was smoking a pack a day. I always had a very good sense that I should quit smoking while I was still ahead. I’ve been a type 1 diabetic for 19 years with no complications to date. Adding cigarettes to my equation was basically a ticking time bomb. I kept putting, quitting smoking, on the back burner due to ‘stress’ and my career. Being a chef. So finally, on my 29th birthday I picked up an ecig instead of a pack of cigarettes and never looked back. The ecigs calmed my nicotine craving but the flavor was just horrible. Yes, even over the taste of tobacco. So I was quickly diving into the vaping aspect of electronic cigarettes. I started small & cheap with my choice of vape pen & have slightly upgraded in the past two months of vaping instead of smoking. I’ve also been dabbing around with local shops & finding the perfect juices that I enjoy most. So the point of this testimonial is to say out loud that vaping has literally allowed me to finally stop smoking for good. I have not touched a cigarette in over two months & plan to never touch one again. I really enjoy vaping & every aspect of doing so. I feel tons better along with the countless other pros of vaping compared to smoking. Ie the smell, cost, health benefits, safety, convenience, choices (flavors & machinery), hygiene & countless other reasons I absolutely prefer vaping over smoking after 14 years.

42,"My name is William. I will be 47 years old in January 2015. I smoked 2 packs of cigarettes a day for 20+ years. I tried to quit 3 times using the patch. It never lasted more than 6 weeks. I would start getting stressed and soon had a smoke in my hand again. The last time it happened my wife suggested I give the e-cigs a try. That did the trick. As of 2014 I am almost 3 years without tobacco. And over the last 6 months I advanced to what we call Vaping. Now I am able to dilute the Vape juice and lower my nicotine intake. On e-cigs (refilling my cartridges instead of buying new ones) I was only able to get down to 6mg of nicotine. But now that I mix my own I am down to 3mg and will soon be halving that again to 1 ½ mg. Over this last 30 plus months my health has improved, my lung capacity has increased, I feel better and have more energy, I don’t smell like an ashtray, and I no longer have reoccurring battles with Bronchitis. And I still have a SAFE outlet for stress. I recommend Vaping or e-cigs to anyone who is serious about kicking the smoking habit and to younger folks goofy enough to consider starting cigarettes. This has added years to my life, made my wife happy, and it is my right. E-cigs and vaping are far safer than smoking, drinking, doing drugs, or having unprotected sex. All of which I have done in years past and do not advocate. Just let me keep my vapes.

45,"48 Years of smoking, 18 years of failed attempts to quit, quit first day with e-cig. Started smoking at age 12, daily smoker by age 16. After my second child I started trying to quit in earnest using most all of the “approved” methods. Cold turkey, gums, lozenges, Wellbutrin (Zyban), patches, all failed past one month. By age 55 I was rolling my own filtered cigarettes due to the high artificial costs of cigarettes imposed “for the public good”. Second longest period of abstinence was 2 weeks during recovery from angioplasty due to CAD at age 57. Set a goal of quitting for my 60th birthday but with two weeks to go I recognized the familiar signs of impending failure and started looking for new alternatives. Thanks to the internet I finally found e-cigarettes and started doing research. Convinced that e-cigs were a FAR less harmful (if not potentially harmless) alternative, finding them sold at my local drugstore was critical to me trying them. I purchased my first “cig-a-like” at 10:00 am on Jan 20, 2012. I have not had a cigarette nor a craving since 10:30 am on Jan 20, 2012. I am currently using a more effective vaping device as well as nicotine level more appropriate for my requirement. After 3 years I have improved breathing, physical stamina, senses of taste and smell, improved cholesterol and blood pressure, improved physical and social environments, reduced congestion and allergies. I still have my rolling equipment and tobacco in a desk drawer just so I can occasionally look at them with contempt for shortening my life. Through their own dogmatic doing by considering vaporized nicotine as harmful as tobacco, I also hold contempt for the FDA, AHA, ACS, and other tobacco control groups for shortening my life through actions and statements that delayed my awareness of e-cigarettes, and through denormalization of vaping and vapers such as myself. I raised two non-smoking children while being a smoker. I am an adult, I like flavors and variety, I am not ashamed or worried about my use of nicotine.

I tried to first quit smoking at the age of 31 because I was having problems walking stairs and hiking which I loved to do. I tried patches which only do not work but make you want to crave more I went to gum and after 3 months was able to quit after 3 month for a year. I started driving trucks got bored and ended up smoking again. I tried to back to gum but it had skyrocketed in price to that equivalent to the price of cigarettes and higher. I thought of all the indignity of it all. the government wants us to quit smoking but allows price hiking and taxes gum I ended up chewing. Back in 2012 I discovered vapor products with nicotine. Not was I able to bring down my nicotine intake, but I was able to walk and even run up stairs without gagging my lungs out. If the FDA screws this one up I most certainly will go back to cigarettes. At present I puff on my vapor machine 3 to 6 times a day, before I was smoking 1.5 to 2 packs a day. another bonus is that I don’t have to worry about inhaling carbon byproducts known to the FDA and scientific public at large to be carcinogenic.

50,"Up to seven days ago, I was not free. I was a slave to my cigarette addiction. For over 30 years, I have fed this addiction with one brand of cigarettes, a pack a day. Seven days ago, I tried E cigarettes and within that first day, I smoked 80% fewer cigarettes. On day six, I was 100% cigarette free. With the variety of e-juices out there and levels of nicotine, I have a taste of freedom in my system. Freedom is a powerful mind-altering experience, one which bolsters self esteem, eradicates limited thinking, nurtures the spirit, and inspires the weak willed. E cigarettes have been the catalyst to this positive change towards health, wellness, and freedom from addiction. I would like to see regulations that hold people in this growing industry accountable for listing ingredients on packaging, clear warnings that nicotine is addictive, and to restrict sale of these products to those under 16. I chose to smoke at age 14 and was addicted by age 16. I have a young daughter and know she may try vaping not cigarettes when she is a teenager. I would not want her to be a slave to an addiction, and at the very least, e cig allow you to choose your nicotine level. I would like the FDA to focus their time and energy on assuring those nicotine levels are accurate on e juices in the market and that the various delivery devices are restricted from use in indoor public places unless duly noted in the establishment. I think e cig users need to be respectful of others when using these products. In the future, I would like to see clear information on all delivery devices with regards to how much nicotine their device emits on average in inhaled and exhaled vapour, so consumers are more informed and can be more accountable in their choices of where and which products to use. Having the choice of nicotine levels in e juice and assurance that those levels are accurate will help me in attaining my goal of being 100% nicotine free and a responsible e-cigarette user. On a final note, I would like to say that I have tried other products that are fully regulated as a smoking cessation tool. Warnings and instructions were clearly written on the labels as to contents, possible side effects etc. I understand not everyone uses e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool, but for those of us that do, this is the level of accountability I would like to see from this growing industry. In fact, I would demand it of the alcohol and tobacco industry as well! Why aren’t the ingredients of cigarettes listed clearly on the package? They don’t even tell you how many mgs of nicotine are in each cancer stick! Ironically, none of this information is of interest to a cigarette addict, until they are trying to quit.

After forty years of smoking EVERYTHING, cigs, cigars, and pipes, I was wheedled by my sweetie to try vaping (her kid brother had made the trade from cigarettes to vaporizer a couple of years prior). August 2012 (2+ years ago), I dipped my toe in the water with an order to Green Smoke and have been in full swim ever since. I vape more heavily than I smoked, but I have not smoked since I started vaping. As a smoker, my nicotine level was pretty high – regular Marlboro. My vaping nicotine level now oscilates between the ultra-lite and zero level. I’m finding that the addiction to the physical simulation of smoking is harder to kick than smoking or nicotine itself – thanks OCD. That anyone is fighting against vaping simply reaffirms my view that the anti-pleasure lobby is alive and well.

53,"Let me tell you about me–
FIRST: How I finally ended a life long battle with smoking. I am 71 and I smoked a 1½ – 2½ quantity or more a day for 55 years. I had tried to quit numerous times using various products. I tried the patches, the gum, SmokEnders and even, several times, cold turkey. All of these methods did not work and I was back to smoking shortly after. I can honestly say that using e-cigarettes has saved my life. I have now been eCig vaping for 16 months, and I can feel the difference everyday. By 1-2 weeks I could breathe. No more coughing! Everything smells better and food tastes better. By 3 months I felt like a whole new person. Which then prompted me to make other changes. I figured if making that one change could make me feel this good, making bigger changes would make me feel even better! I changed the way I eat, the things I drink, and I started exercising. In three months I have lost 17lbs! I couldn’t/would have made these changes as a smoker. Electronic cigarettes “are not the be all, end all” solution to nicotine addiction — but they are the best first step! They save lives! Please do not take away this opportunity for the members of your community to make their lives better! You will not regret making the right decision and removing electronic cigarettes from this Bans, “Sin Tax”, and future bans! SECOND:, I will do what ever to keep vaping. I’m not going to go back to killing myself because Big Tobacco and Big Pharmacy are losing money and that’s what this FDA move is about: it’s all about money. The proposed regulations in their current form would devastate the e-cigarette industry, with the paperwork burden driving more that 99% of producers out of business or into shadow markets. This will almost certainly leave only “Cig-a-Likes” produced by the largest companies available in the FDA-regulated market. It is also likely that nicotine-containing liquids for refillable devices will be unavailable except for on the black or shadow markets. While flavors are not explicitly banned by these proposed regulations, it is widely believed that the FDA will seek to eliminate flavors other than tobacco and menthol in the future. If the proposed regulations pass, I won’t buy the Cig-a-Likes -they didn’t work for me and I don’t want to go back to tobacco or anything that resembles a cigarette. I also won’t go back to buying cigarettes which is obviously what the FDA wants. I believe that if you put stringent regulations on the e-cigarette business it will only lead myself and others back to what you claim to be hazardous to our health. Cigarettes! By using different flavored products like e-juice it has kept me from wanting a cigarette. Also the multiple delivery devices, what we call mods and atty’s, cannot be replaced by something as simple as a “Cig-a-Likes”. This in no way can sooth the cravings that most people have. To limit this to just a couple of Big Tobacco Companies, the same people who for years told us that smoking was safe, is like handing the keys of a prison to the inmates and asking them to keep the door locked! I also believe that restricting from whom, where, and what Adults can buy their products from will only lead to a secondary market with No Regulations! Just how safe do you think that will be? THIRD: While e-cigarette flavors are not limited by the proposed regulations, FDA is specifically asking for information about the connection between flavors and e-cigarette use by children. The questions posed by the FDA in connection with flavors are leading and thinly-veiled. They suggest it is likely that if FDA gains regulatory control over e-cigarettes, FDA will later seek to ban all flavors other than tobacco and perhaps menthol. In fact, FDA has specifically stated that the current proposed regulations are only the first step in their attempts to regulate e-cigarettes. A ban on flavors (other than tobacco and menthol) would directly impact me (i.e., make me less happy). Yes flavors help me distance myself away from my former smoking habit this way: I feel like I don’t have that tobacco flavor in my mouth and I don’t even feel like I am smoking anymore because of the flavors: fruity, beverage and bakery flavors, which is better for me as it is completely unlike tobacco. The variety in flavors keeps me away because having options available like strawberry or other flavors like that keep me interested in vaping because the flavors are delicious. Yes I believe that it should not be sold to minors. Yes there should be some standards on the packaging labels such as nicotine levels, ingredients and the like. I also believe that childproof caps are necessary, but to completely gut an industry and give to those who lied to us for years is completely insane! To say that children are enticed by flavored nicotine juice is a complete falsehood. Where was, or is your concern for the children when it comes to flavored liquor or beers. The last time I looked you can find that anywhere! Supermarkets, Drug stores, even the local convenient stores has shelves with such products. Outrage? Right?",Let me tell you about me–,http://vaping.info/news/2014/let-tell
54,"I’m 40 yrs old. I started experimenting with cigarettes when I was 12 or 13 yrs old. By the time I was 16 I had a pack and a half to two pack a day habit. I spent the next 20 plus yrs battleing chronic bronchitis, asthma, and regular bouts of pneumonia that led to regular hospitalizations. All that makes the tens of thousands of dollars I spent on cigarettes seem like a secondary concern. I tried desperately to quit. I tried the gum, the patch, the lozenges, even the medications with no success. About 2 and a half yrs ago I experimented with an E-Cig. I swiftly moved from ego type batteries and cartomizers to VV/VW mods, and now am using a mechanical mod and rebuildable atomizer. The most impressive part of all this is that after my first ego, I never smoked another cigarette. I haven’t smoked in over two years and I have no desire to smoke again ever. In fact I now am one of the people that used to annoy me. I can’t stand the smell of tobacco smoke. I turn my nose up at the smell of smokers even when they’re not smoking. I haven’t had any lung problems in years. I can smell and taste things again and my doctor no longer lectures me. I know that vaping has increased my quality of life immeasurably.

The next day I bought my own from a gas station, I did my research and found out about the ego style e cigs and bought my first kit.

E-cigarettes became increasingly popular around my husband’s work (Active Duty Army) and we both decided it was time to quit smoking and try vaping. I smoked my last cigarette on a Thursday and bought an e-go e-cigarette the following Saturday, and I haven’t looked back since. I attempted to buy a pack of cigarettes, just as a test, about 2 weeks after I’d quit smoking and I couldn’t even take one normal puff. It was horrible and made me nauseous and I threw it out with the rest of the pack and haven’t touched one since! Vaping really does work and I know too many people that have quit to think otherwise!

He hooked me up with a new way to kick the habit and it worked!!! I am proud to say I don’t smoke cigarettes anymore. and healthwise i feel so much better!

64,"I’m a 25 year-old female who began smoking menthol tobacco cigarettes in November of 2010. I started smoking to deal with the stress of being a single parent, part-time waitress, and full-time nursing student. After a few months, I became a pack-a-day smoker.
I graduated nursing school in 2013 and interviewed for a registered nurse position at a local hospital. I was offered a position on the Pulmonary and Oncology floor. I was happy I’d be working with lung disease and cancer patients since my mother, a 30+ year smoker, had been diagnosed with lung cancer the previous year. I’d be able to help take better care of her and even visit her in her hospital room while on duty. June 23, 2013, three days after accepting my first real job, my mom passed away. As much as I wanted to quit smoking then, the stress was unbearable. I succumb to my habit to satiate my addiction.
On July 31, 2014, I curiously entered a vape store. I didn’t have the intention of quitting smoking just yet, but I wanted to try something new. I walked out with a vape pen and a bottle of cappuccino flavored e-juice. Now, a little over a month later, I’m tobacco free. I’ve been using my vape pen daily and I’ve not experienced any ill effects. I plan on tapering down my nicotine level so that I can break the habit all together, eventually. Being able to quit using tobacco is a feat to which I don’t have words to describe. It’s better than a “good job.” It’s more like, “save-your-life-incredible.” I love not smelling like cigarette smoke. I love that my son no longer endures the harmful effects of my bad choices. I don’t feel the guilt of hypocrisy when teaching my patients about smoking cessation. I recently married, and I’m encouraging my new husband to quit smoking, too. This is life-changing, and I strongly encourage anyone and everyone who is struggling to quit smoking to give vaping a try. It worked for me.

My diabetes and high blood pressure are now under control due to regular exercise. My knee problems have improved dramatically…I can kneel on the floor again and get up without help. Anyone who says the vaping is in any way damaging like smoking is just plain wrong. All the other obvious benefits like not being smelly, not burning clothes and furniture, not exposing my asthmatic son and husband to second hand smoke, not wasting time being on smoke breaks, go without saying.

66,"I started smoking when I was twelve years old. At the height of my smoking I was smoking almost 2 packs a day. I always told myself I would quit when I was 40. I tried many times starting in my 30s. I did manage to get down to a pack a day habit but I was still unhappy. My son became a smoker. My daughter is not but hated living with me due to the smell. When I turned 53 I decided I had to do something. I bought a popular cig a like kit from a local drug store, discovered that their Cherry flavor was very satisfying. That led me to a liitle bigger equipment and a variety of flavors from tobacco like flavors to candy flavors to popular drink flavors. I love it. I have not used a cigarette since I started and I am now going on a year and a half without tobacco. Smells are wonderful. Things smell great. My blood pressure went down as well as my actual nicotine use. I definitely credit vaping with all that. I’ve tried pills, patches, hypnotism, lozenges, and cessation classes in the past and this is the only one that works, works well and works without guilt. I am happy and I’m sure I will continue to be a happy vaper even if I drop all the way down to zero nicotine which is just a personal goal.

I am sick and tired of big tobacco trying to stop vapers, so they can make more money while their products are killing people. The only reason the FDA is making these draconian regulations is because big tobacco lobbyists are making them, or the big tobacco won’t keep giving money to politicians for their campaigns. It’s all about money for the politicians, they don’t care about the health of people. Vaping is safe and has changed my life. We all have to get together and stop big tobacco from trying to kill the vaping industry, just so they can make big profits. Why aren’t cigarettes illegal? They are known to kill people.

71,"I started vaping on January 19, 2013 after smoking cigarettes for 20 years. I smoked 15-20 cigarettes per day during those 20 years. Vaping has changed my life, and it has allowed me to quit smoking completely and immediately – once I started vaping I never picked up another cigarette after January 19, 2013. Vaping has been an effective method of cigarette smoking cessation for me, even when almost all other available methods – nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, nicotine patch, Zyban (Bupropion) – did not help me quit smoking cigarettes. My family is no longer subjected to second hand cigarette smoke, and when I vape I don’t do it inside or around my family or friends, so they’re not subjected to the vapor, either. My clothes and car no longer smell like cigarette smoke. I can smell and taste things I was unable to when I smoked cigarettes, and my breathing is so much better – I no longer get winded as easily as I used to when I smoked cigarettes. My wife and infant daughter are able to enjoy the benefits of my not smoking, and I ultimately look forward to a longer, healthier life with them since I quit smoking cigarettes. Additionally, I was spending about $5-6 per day on cigarettes, which came out to about $35-40 per week. I only spend about $10-12 per week vaping. The savings has also improved my family’s life. If vaping becomes regulated, I understand that many eliquids and personal vaporizing devices may become unavailable, or much harder to obtain. My vaping journey took me from starting out with an eGO style battery and cartomizer to a variable voltage/wattage APV with tank and cartomizer, through to a mechanical mod and rebuildable dripping atomizer, which I currently use. I get the best vaping satisfaction and results from my current mechanical mod and rebuildable dripping atomizer, though the next step I take may be to a higher capacity variable voltage/wattage APV with a rebuildable dripping or tank atomizer, which many view as the “ultimate” in vaping devices. Regardless, the regulation by the FDA of vaping devices and consumables like eLiquid may not make this effective method for quitting smoking that I currently practice available to me, or the method with which I choose to vape may become unavailable, which has been the only method of smoking cessation that has worked for me. Please don’t allow the FDA to take away the only method of smoking cessation that has worked for me – vaping – and force me to return to smoking cigarettes again. FDA regulation of vaping, e-cigarettes and eLiquids would only benefit Big Tobacco, which I’ve worked so hard to get away from, and which could have killed me and affected my family and my community adversely. Taxing e-cigarettes and eLiquids is unacceptable, as well, and will only drive up the costs of vaping, cause small brick-and-mortar and web-based vape shops to close, stifle innovation i n the vaping community and deter so many people from turning to vaping as a viable, safe and effective method of cigarette smoking cessation. The impact on the vaping community as a whole, of which I am a part, my family, friends, community, and ultimately my health, longevity and financial well-being may be seriously damaged by FDA regulation of personal vaporizing devices and consumables. The FDA has already said that e-cigarettes are safer than smoking cigarettes. Please don’t let the FDA regulate my, and so many other’s, safe and effective method of cigarette smoking cessation out of existence.

And I am 47. So I have snoked for at least 37 years. Smoked my dad’s cig buts by 10. Yes, that is disgusting, but I was hooked bad!! By 12 yrs old I was ward of the court, so I spent 4 years in and out of group homes, and shelter homes, and I could smoke in them. I had the choice of 70 cents a day for chores, or a pack of my favorite cigs. So I can literally say my government hooked me on cigs. This is truth, and if anyone looked into this, I am sure they would see thousands of packs of cigs given to minors.
     So the bottom line is that I have a new , but healthier vise that gets me through my day. No thanks to any government participation.",an unexpected journey,http://vaping.info/news/2014/an-unexpected-journey
84,"I’m a 30 year smoker of over a pack a day.  I started stealing my parents cigarettes back in elementary school, and became daily smoker by the age of 15.  Both my parents were heavy smokers and I watched them both pass away from smoking related illness (cancer), only a few short years apart from each other.  My father had his jaw surgically removed due to cancer.  On his dying bed, my father pleaded with me to quick smoking.   I had tried to quit many times over the years.  I tried cold turkey, used the patch, chewed the nicotine gum, lozenges, and even tried Chantix.  Nothing worked for me.  During Christmas a couple years back, my wife gave me my first e-cigarette, shaped and looked like a cigarette.  I thought it was a novel idea and worked as a crutch in times I could not have a real cigarette.  But I still smoked.  It was not until another family member gave me a more advanced kit did I find my way out.  I did not expect to quit.  Shortly after receiving the gift, I got a nasty fever and was bed ridden for 2 days and relied solely on my new mod/tank as I lay in bed.  It was a very concentrated nicotine level of 36mg/ml.  But it worked!  After I felt better, I went outside to light up a cigarette and it tasted awful!  At that point, I put my cigarettes away and became a “vaper”.  That was 1 ½ years ago and am proud to say that it has been easy for me to reduce my nicotine down to 6mg/ml.  I also lost the taste for tobacco flavorings fairly quickly.  I love desert flavors, fruit flavors, candy flavors and all combinations of these flavors. I feel better than I have in many years.  My lungs are healing and can breathe better.  I can perform more physical activities without getting winded.  My taste buds healed. I can now taste my food again.  I no longer smell like smoke.  My car no longer smells like smoke.  My wife is very happy with this transformation.  I have become an advocate for e-cigarettes and have gotten other friends to make the change, all with similar results.  I am proud to have made the switch to e-cigarettes.  They have saved my life and have saved countless other’s lives.  It has the potential to save millions of lives.  But to what extent will be up to our regulatory agencies.  I agree that regulation is needed.  Overregulation will kill this industry and kill more smokers.  If E-cigarettes were around 20 years ago, I may still have my parents here with me today.  My daughter would have her grandparents.",Testimonial,http://vaping.info/news/2014/testimonial-4
85,"I’m 23 years, and almost 4 years sober. Throughout my life, chemicals have been a REAL problem. For the last few years, my life has been greatly improved with the absence of drugs and alcohol, and the last lingering vestige of my struggle was my inability to quit smoking cigarettes. My dad, my grandpa, and my uncle have all suffered life shortening and severely handicapping health consequences from smoking, and I was well on my way. Last summer, I was introduced to vaping by a classmate, and I haven’t looked back since. My cardiovascular and circulatory systems have shown medically quantifiable improvement because of this, and there have been countless other casual benefits (the absence of odor, for one). This is a tool that I have used to greatly improve my quality of life, and extend my life expectancy. I hope that as a society we can see it only fit to allow our citizens to participate in behaviors that are practical and life enhancing, and as one of the youth of this nation, I fully expect it.

86,"Hello all you folks over the pond. Don’t know if there is a British Vaping Association but there bloody well should be. I began smoking at 14 and at my tobacco addicted height, was chugging back 1.5 packs a day or 30 cigs a day. I smelt bad, could not taste a thing and had a horrible, hacking cough. I had tried everything to quit, patches, gum, nicotine pills, nothing worked. I was resigned to dying young (I’m now 52) because I could not get off the weed, no matter what.
Then, a very close friend (a former model) died of lung cancer because of her fag (cigarette in British slang) habit and it really shook me. At the same time, a friend suggested I tried vaping. I walked into the vape shop, bought a starter kit and never looked back. I am now smoke free, hate the smell of tobacco smoke, and celebrate every day that I am free at last. On the very first day of vaping, I tore up my fags and threw away all the ask trays, something I would not have contemplated before. I will soon be cutting down to zero nicotine in my vape juice but, quite frankly, am intensely relaxed about when I do. I have not felt this good in 30 years. I have started to exercise, am losing weight and can enjoy sport diving again. It’s a miracle.",My Testimony,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-testimony-16
87,"I was a pack and a half a day smoker for 44 years.  For twenty years I wanted desperately to quit and tried most every smoking secession method available.  I tried nicotine patches and gum, hypnotism, non-invasive acupuncture, Zyban and Chantix without success.  On March 8th of this year I bought my first electronic cigarette and quit had my last cigarette on March 9th.   E-cigarettes give me the feeling of smoking without most of the harmful compounds that were destroying my lungs since i was 12 years old.  My current nicotine level is 6mg and I have ordered my first zero nicotine level e-liquid this week.   I enjoy vaping but I am not sure if I will continue to vape when I am confident that I won’t return to smoking cigarettes but I think vaping is an important option to those of us are desperate to end our addiction to cigarettes. I understand there may be risks inherent in vaping I am confident that for me they are considerably fewer and less severe than those related to smoking – especially given the damage I have done to my lungs over the years.  While some regulation over the contents of e-liquids would probably be beneficial the current FDA proposal seems to go much to far and may eventually reduce the options smokers have to help themselves stop smoking.  This would be unwise and unhealthy.",Director of Shared Servies,http://vaping.info/news/2014/director-of-shared-servies
88,"I’ve been smoking heavily for years and tried quitting so many times. Smoking made me depressed. Just the thought of waking up each day and inhaling something all day long that makes me ill and will likely cause my death really got to me. I was one of the first to try a e-cig back when the cig-a-likes came out. I was very disappointed to say the least and went back to smoking. But when the ego’s came out I tried again and BOOM like a miracle I quit tobacco within 3 days and never looked back…. Seriously it is like a miracle and I’m so grateful that I have this alternative! For anyone wondering: No, I don’t crave cigarettes at all anymore! It takes time to fully change from smoking to vaping but stick with it…. I first used e-cigs to take the edge of the cigarette craving…. Now I can’t even think of smoking a cig….. Vaping has become my cigarette….PERIOD.",Its a true Miracle,http://vaping.info/news/2014/its-a-true-miracle
89,"When I bought my 1st e-cig, I did so for ONE reason; and, that reason ONLY: I’d gotten stuck in Wal-Mart one time too many, around “19 million screaching rug-rats, not a one of who’s parents was doing ANYTHING to even TRY to control them…” I had several sets of tubes in my ears as a child; and, that high-pitched shreak that kids seem to love to make (as well as key cutting machines) feels like someone driving an ice pick into my ear drums. Also, at 60, I come from an era where parents were actually expected to either keep their kids under control in public; or, leave them with a sitter until the kid was old enough to be controllable! Having kids was seen as taking on a responsibility – rather than just a bodily function… None of this mixes well with “growing fangs” for a nicotine “fix” – something of an understatement… I’m one of those folks who lost ALL interest in even trying to quit smoking when the push to harass smokers out of existence began. Prior to that point, my (occasional; but, sole) motivation had been my not liking the idea of “being controlled” by ANYTHING. When they started trying to force folks to quit, though economics, social engineering, and restriction of places we could smoke, it just resulted in my becoming an even more adamant smoker! When they started jacking the prices up to absurd levels, my “solution” was to invest in a 440# case of unprocessed “strip tobacco.” After about a week of smoking this unprocessed tobacco, I bought a pack of the brand I’d been smoking about 2 cartons a week, for going out to a dinner with some friends. After just 2 drags, I gave that pack to my friend’s wife, went to the car, got some of my rolled cigarettes, instead. The manufactured cigs tasted like they’d been soaked in floor stripper! (Now, I know why – the 4,000+ chemicals that cigarette manufacturers add in the “paper making process” that tobacco goes through to be turned into cigarettes.) When I had to sell my house, I went back and bought 3 more cases. I literally have “a lifetime supply” of tobacco; and, my only on-going cost was about $60/yr for ground clove; and, about $100/yr. for rolling papers.  I’d found a juice that was really tasty (50% orange-pineapple and 50% clove); so, I’d upgraded a step from those junk cig-a-likes; and, occasionally vaped even when it wasn’t my only option. My hands give me a lot of trouble; especially during cold weather. I keep them usable during such times by 1st cleaning them with 1 tsp. of 68% calcium hypochlorite (1 specific form of “pool shock”) dissolved into 8oz of distilled water; followed by a mix of 50% DMSO and 50% distilled water. Straighten my hands out FAST! (Warning – in case anyone decides to try this: DMSO will draw anything that’s on the skin into the bloodstream. I’ve found that pre-cleaning w/calcium hypochlorite has always been safe for me. NEVER use DMSO without pre-cleaning the area; and, ***NEVER*** use anything like hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, etc. as a pre-cleaner!!! Folks doing so was what gave DMSO an unjustified bad-rap years ago…)  There was a pretty bad cold front here during Feb. 2013; and, I couldn’t find where I’d put my DMSO. To make matters worse, the roads were too bad for me to be able to get into town to buy another bottle of it.  My hands were so sore that rolling cigarettes really hurt; but, I was doing it, anyway. THEN, it occurred to me to try to just get by with vaping until I could find my DMSO; or, get out to get more. I wound up vaping exclusively for about 4 days. I was able to find my DMSO, got my hands straightened out, grabbed my rolling kit, and lit the first one I got rolled. At first, I thought I must’ve rolled something that a rodent had used the bathroom on! I went out and got a fresh batch, cleaned it, and rolled it. It tasted just as bad!!! I tried for about a week to wean myself back over to my cigarettes; but, after that, I just gave up and accepted the fact that I was now “a vaper,” instead of a smoker…  There are 2 factors to which I attribute this unintended switch: 1) FLAVORS and 2) the fact that I was vaping high (36mg/ml) nic juice; since, I’d bought it just for “quick fixes” in places where I couldn’t light up when I needed to… If either hadn’t been the case, I’d still be happily smoking away.      It’ll soon be of June, 2014; and, I haven’t even tried to smoke since Feb. 2013. Even though I sometimes “chain vape,” I’ve slowly eased back to the point where most of my juice is in the 15 mg/ml range. (I blend most of my own juices; so, I have complete control over my mixtures.) Since it IS “strictly up to me,” I’ve been slowly working my way on down towards 0 mg/ml, at a pace that avoids my “growing fangs.” When I reach that point, maybe I’ll quit; maybe I’ll continue to vape 0 nic, just so I won’t start gaining weight…      I feel like throwing something at my tv set when the “flavors attracts children” idiots come on, blathering their same, tired, garbage to the “sheeple” who refuse to think for themselves. 1) I’m 60 yrs. old; and, my taste buds still work just fine! Had it not been for the flavor difference, I’d still be smoking!  2) If parents don’t want their kids to get hooked on nicotine, they need to take responsibility for their own off-spring. If people don’t want the responsibilities associated with parenthood, they need to be more sexually responsible; or, that failing, put the resulting offspring up for adoption.      Most of what I typed is probably counter-productive; since, the bottom line in this attack on vaping has nothing what-so-ever to do with “protecting” anyone except the industries who’s profits are being threatened by e-cigs; or, who want to monopolize it if they can’t kill it. Given that studies have already proven that vaping produces no harmful 2nd hand chemicals (with “2nd hand smoke being one of their primary excuses for harassing smokers); given vaping’s unparalleled results in getting people off of cigarettes; given the dangers associated with garbage like Chantix and Wellbutrin; and, given the dangers associated with the obesity that so often follows quitting smoking, any LEGITIMATE agency would do everything in their power to HELP this fledgling avenue for folks to get away from Big Tobacco’s crap. Those who brought us toxic wastes such as Aspartame and Fluoride (toxic waste) couldn’t care less what’s good for us – only what’s good for Big Pharma!","42 1/2 yr.

90,"Today marks 108 days without a cigarette (3,240 unsmoked tobacco cigs) for me. I had a horrible smokers cough that developed after my 30+ yr “social smoker” habit became a 1 1/2 pk a day habit. It kept me up at night and I got to where I couldn’t even laugh without feeling like I was going to hack up a lung. And for someone like me, who loves to laugh, this was miserable. In addition to this, on July 31, 2012, I was told that I had stage III Inflammatory Breast Cancer. IBC is the most deadly form of breast cancer and the prognosis is rarely good. The five year survival rate is very low. I’m a single mother of a seven-year-old boy and I have no family, but I fought. After 16 weeks of two different kinds of chemo, a Radical Bilateral Mastectomy, & 8 weeks of intense radiation, I was declared N.E.D. (No Evidence of Disease). One of the things my doctor told me to do besides exercise, eating right and taking my medicine is to quit smoking. He said if I could get through all “that” that I was strong enough to quit. I told him it was the smoking that helped me get through all “that.” Nevertheless I tried… just about everything  –including cheap “gas station” ecigs –with no success. Then, this past January, I bought my 1st ego kit. A little 650 mah & a CE4 tank.  I struggled a little at first, but I stuck with it. Not only that, but I spent hours online studying. I was a sponge. Still am.
I’ve gone from 12 mgs of nicotine ejuice to 8… to 6…to 4… and many days I Vape 0 nicotine. Yes, I’m addicted to Vaping, but smoking was never this much fun and it certainly never tasted this good. My Oncologist is 100% behind me, my son is happier, my house, car, clothes & breath have never smelled better and I can breath again. I’ve made so many new friends from all over the world because of Vaping. Cigarettes never did that.  I’ve even learned how to build my own coils and make my own juice; safely and economically.
And as I sit here & type this, tobacco free, I can’t help but feel thankful for this technology and proud of how far I’ve come. Again, that’s 108 days smoke free. …3,240 tobacco cigarettes not smoked. …$907.20 not spent on tobacco.

91,"I was a smoker for 20 years, and never smoked a “light” cigarette. I just happened to wander into a Vapor store in my home town that was beside a mattress store my wife and I were at one night. I went in a got somewhat educated on what I should start with and walked out of the store with a typical starter kit to get me going. I smoked one more cigarette that night and one more the next morning and and havent smoked one since. This was 8 months ago and I havent felt this good in a long time. I can breathe better, I can smell, and I can taste things again. No morning hacking and coughing either. My wife says I am not snoring as much either. She also loves the fact that I dont stink anymore. Vaping has truly changed my life for the better. I have gone down to 3 mg of nicotine and plan to go to zero nicotine in the next few weeks. This is by far the easiest way to STOP smoking and STAY STOPPPED. No gums or patch or pill will ever compare.",quit smoking in one day,http://vaping.info/news/2014/quit-smoking-in-one-day
92,"I subsidized Big Tobacco for 36 years.  Like so many smokers (and I find this ironic in the present) I started as a child, with Marlboro 100s for the first 13 years, then rolling Top Tobacco (single mom here) for the last 23.  I had no other health issues at my full check up in 2012 except for the first signs of COPD on my lungs.
Neither of my adult children smoke, nor did they ever get their hands on my lighters or cigs when I smoked.  My daughter got me a cigalike, which helped but only kept me dual using (also common).
Then my son got me an Ego, and that worked for good.  I have been smoke free for 3 and a half months, started with vanilla flavor, then found my perfect all day vape in pina colada flavor, but I also like raspberry, blueberry, melon and fruit blends (not citrus) in general.  Did not like cotton candy, but I dont like that in real life either.  40 pg 60 vg juices from my local vape shop; child proof caps and labeling and all.
I think what works about the flavors is they disassociate our fix of nicotine from ashtray and/or menthol flavors.  This product is marketed to smokers who could not quit any other way, or did not want to quit but found it easy for a change.
I was already an active, walking kind of person, but my sense of smell and taste are even better.  I had been just beginning to lose my breath coming up hills, and that went away almost immediately.  My daughter used to flinch away from me when I sat down beside her; once I started vaping, she quit doing that.  My granddaughters like that I smell like vanilla and fruit, and my family is proud of me – my parents didnt smoke, but all 6 of us kids took it up, and only one of us managed to quit without help.  I have been telling every smoker I know about this, NOT in a preachy way, but most smokers by the age of 50 notice what smoking is doing to them, have tried NRTs and relapsed, and are thus more receptive when a former smoker tells them vaping is not just another false hope.  I think we should save all the smokers we can while the FDA waffles…word of mouth is what works, keep the Big Boys losing money and keep local small businesses (vape shops) open.  Keep the money in our own states and communities, because we are consumers, voters, and adults, and we should all keep doing what they do until vaping drives killer cigs into finally being snuffed out for good

93,"When I first discovered e-cigarettes back in 2009 it was never about quitting, and to be honest I knew very little about the concept of harm reduction. It was the fact that here’s a gadget that makes what looks and feels like smoke, yet not being smoke. There was a WOW!! factor. Over time I found myself vaping more often than smoking, and I enjoyed the sensation and taste more. I’m what you would class as a “dual user”, I still smoke from time to time, and I have absolutely no embarrassment in that fact. I still really enjoy smoking. For me, every time I vape is a regular cigarette not smoked. Vaping as it is, with the choice of product and flavour available as well as the community that has grown up around this new pastime helps me forget that I do smoke because I have found that I enjoy the sensation of vaping, more so than traditional smoking.",A more than adequate alternative,http://vaping.info/news/2014/a-more-than-adequate-alternative

95,"I started smoking at age 15. I couldn’t go 5 minutes without one. I couldn’t go anywhere that didn’t allow smoking, from restaurants, family events, hotel rooms,you name it they disallowed it I avoided it. I smoked 2 packs a day every day. I spent roughly $100 a week on tobacco. I panicked when my carton of smokes would hit the two pack mark & would rush back to the store to buy another carton. I was smoking more than ever before although my health was failing me.  I had serious ear & sinus infections that would not go away. My allergies were out of control. My respiratory tract & immune system was fighting me every second of every day. I was sick constantly; bronchitis, allergies, sinus & ear infections, just to name a few health problems. I wont mention being diagnosed with high blood pressure at age 30 something. EVERY.SINGLE.WEEK. I was ill and at my doctors office. I coughed before bed every night & every morning when I awoke. I attempted to quit smoking AT LEAST half a dozen times. Once with gum, once with patches, once with big pharmas drugs, then back to patches. Nothing was working, I only gained the desire to smoke more, I gained tons of weight. All of this despite disliking the way cigarette smoke smelled, despising..no, hating the way tobacco cigarettes taste. …In February of 2014 I learned a lot of POSITIVES about e-cigarettes & vaping. I’d heard of these methods before but they were horror stories. I heard real stories from real people, those who quit analogs. Quit tobacco forever. It didn’t take long to try out true “e-cigarettes”, the pen like electronic devices with cartridges. I knew these were close enough to get me on the road to the BIG QUIT. It didn’t take a week to find a battery and a clearomizer, dessert flavored e-liquid & I then knew, I could put down the analogs forever. I stepped down from a 24mg to 18mh 10 12mg eliquid & I am on the downward nicotine spiral. Although, I ENJOY vaping. I LOVE the sweet flavored liquids. I love my mods.  Not two weeks after my 41st birthday I quit analogs for good. Its been over 2 months now without smoking ONE SINGLE CIGARETTE. My health has improved 100%, not one infection since I quit. No more stinky clothes, no more stinky car. I can taste my food! I am not popping ANY allergy meds this Spring, a first living in the South! Ive gained no extra weight! No more spending hours at the doctors office for steroids & antibiotics, nasal sprays & ear drops, no more blood pressure spikes no hand full of pills two, three four times a day to keep whatever illness at bay. No more hundreds of dollars blown every month on illness or my habit. My husband quit alongside of me just a few days after I did.  We feel so much younger & so much healthier. My doctors are thrilled.  I am so much happier. My husband is so much happier. Our children couldn’t be more pleased. Dozens of our friends vape and no longer use tobacco. We have taken back control of our lives that once revolved around tobacco.

About I gave up a 28 year relationship with cigarettes and cigars on February 6, 2013. My Dad saw me quit tobacco just four weeks before he died from lung cancer. He tried ecigs before I did and encouraged me to quit. He gave me his kit because it was too strong for him and he was too far gone by then. I smoked a pack a day for 28 years and quit overnight thanks to ecigs. Seriously, electronic cigarettes or e-cigs are my Declaration Seeking Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness… from tobacco.  I started smoking cigarettes as a young teenager and later added cigars to the mix.  I found ecigs and the rest is history.  My family really appreciates the fact that I don’t stink and I just might live a little longer.  My overall health has improved tremendously.  I can now walk and run for extended periods without complications from smoking combustible tobacco.  My sinus issues have all but dissapeared completely and my snoring… well that’s another story.   Electronic cigarettes have saved me in so many ways that I cannot explain here.  My only hope is to help smokers switch to ecigs and give back to the community that supported me. #kcavo #IfYouVapeAdvocate #EcigsSaveLives #IMPROOF",I smoked a pack a day for 28 years and quit overnight thanks to ecigs.,http://vaping.info/news/2014/i-smoked-a-pack-a-day-for-28-years-and-quit-overnight-thanks-to-ecigs

98,"I was a pack a day smoker for 10 years, on and off for 15. My first cigarette was at 12 years old. I loved smoking, but not as much as I love vaping. I always knew the negative side effects of smoking, but I ignored them until I no longer could. My smokers cough, the things I would hack up every morning, the first breath waking up after a night out, getting winded while playing with my dog or my daughter and the way I smelled. I tried to quit smoking dozens if not hundreds of times. When electronic cigarettes first came on the market, I tried all of them, the disposable cigalikes, the blu starter kits, I tried with the gum and the patch too. I always went back to cigarettes. I would find myself pulling into a gas station, buying a pack, lighting up, and being disgusted with myself. I should have had more willpower. I didn’t even enjoy them. One night, my friend let me try his ego style battery with a Protank 2 and his mechanical mod and RDA. Wow. I never knew this side of electronic cigarettes. I tossed my Camel Blues the next day and bought a starter kit. I haven’t had a cigarette since. In my first month of vaping I bought multiple batteries, tanks and flavors of juice. I never knew quitting cigarettes could be so fun! I never knew that “e-cigs” could be so satisfying, and so much MORE satisfying than traditional tobacco cigarettes. Vaping has since become a hobby, much like cooking, building models and photography. It has become a way to express my individuality. My personal healthy and quality of life has improved ten fold. I can play with my dog longer without getting winded, I can keep up with my daughter, I can run, take a full breath and taste food again. I will never smoke another cigarette again, unless, the current proposed FDA regulations go into affect and kill the e
cig market. The new regulations will make it possible for only big tobacco to have a place in the market as they are the only ones who can afford to pay the application fees, and have such few electronic cigarette products on the market.

Then after a week I thought, maybe I’ll stick with it. WE Then I started to notice I was using 2 Blues a day.  I thought well that’s too expensive.  I then found a shop that had Kanger EVOD starter kits and found flavors.  At this point I realized that one, I could breath, two, my house, clothes and car no longer smelled like an ashtray.  The next thing I noticed was my sense of taste and smell improved drastically.  The REAL difference came at my job.  I do apartment maintenance, and when I smoked if I was to move a refrigerator up three flights of steps, I would be out of breath, have to stop at each floor and recover and sweating my you know what off.  Just the other day I moved a refrigerator to a third floor apartment.  Three flights of steps, no stopping at each floor, not out of breath and barely broke a sweat.  I have also become such a believer in vaping over smoking, that a friend and I have recently opened an E-Cig store.  I have quit smoking in the past.

After seeing all these eGo’s all over the place, and trying a few, I decided to give it another whirl with low expectations; it was really just to slow down, or even for fun. I quit smoking the first week I got my eGo, about 2 months ago. Now it’s a hobby, with mechanical mods, making my own juice and so on! The thing that I think separates my story from the rest is how many people I got to willingly follow my path. My aunt (a pack and a half to two packs a day for 35+ years), my uncle (who had to quit because of a heart attack, and still couldn’t stop; 40+ years), my mom (a pack to two packs a day for 30 years), my cousins fiance (a pack a day for 10 years), and various friends.

That is a real crime! I have committed to myself and the others around me from second hand smoke!! I have tried blues they worked for a while like 2 to three days but they were to expensive I could not afford the  coast the refills cost more than the cigarettes do. Then I went back to cigarettes for a year. Just last week I walked into a smoke shop to buy a cheap pack of cigarettes that were made in Korea buy the way and saw the vape section. I was stoped immediately the flavors and bigger systems longer battery life I was shocked! All the problems that I had with the mini s were gone! I was in this shop for about 30 min asking the clerk all kinds of questions while my wife www aimed in the car with my children. When I finally returned I was asked why so long in the store? as I explained my new found interest in the new vapor tech that I had just found we headed home. I got online and spent a few hours researching vape pros com’s etc. I liked the blue style mini and the health implications it had bit it was not functional and not cost effective. You see im poor I have no money at the end of my week my addiction is not helping that situation!! I feel bad like I’ve let my family down I go into deep depression about that! So I convinced my wife to let me take the money that I spend on cigarettes for that week and let me get a starter kit to try. Keep in mind I had spent a lot of money on the mini systems already and this was a very sore subject. I managed to get approval and we went back an I bought a reasonable starter kit.

I’m much healthier as a result – no daily hacking, coughing, chronic bronchitis, etc.  My clothes, house, and car no longer stink.  I am such an advocate that I’ve volunteered for over a year educating smokers on the advantages of vaping.  I’m proud to say I’ve coached hundreds of adults to stop smoking.

Yes, most times 0 nicotine. And I am starting my new life! I have lost the unwanted weight, I can ride my bike again, I am off the blood pressure meds, and haven’t felt this good in years.

I knew it was bad for me, but I enjoyed it too much to want to just give it up. I even tried using gas station e-cigs to quit once, but they were so junky and did no more to stop me smoking than quitting cold turkey did. I decided to try a little higher end e-cig to see if that would help, so I got an Ego Twist and a Evod. I was really impressed with it and was able to get away from cigarettes almost immediately, however it didn’t satisfy me at the times I wanted my pipe, so I ended up being a dual-user for a little while because I did not get the warmth, density, or flavor from my Evod that I got from my pipe. After watching some YouTube videos from GrimmGreen and Rip Trippers talking about rebuildables and sub-ohm vaping, along with the warmth, density, and flavor from it, I decided to give it a try.

At this point I use e cigs at a low 6mg or 0mg at occasions that would cause me to smoke socially and has been an amazing success. Not only has the e CIG been helping me as a whole, it has opened me up to a community of people that are in the same stage of relief. I’m also a collector of mechanical e cigs known as “mods” and this hobby has kept my focus off of tobacco products and enjoying the collecting of beautiful harmless devices such as these. Knowing that the possibility of these “mods” being deemed illegal based on some literature included in the proposed regulation utterly saddens me as they are essentially the same devices that would remain legal such as the njoy ecig made by a large tobacco company.

129,"I am 33 years old, I was smoker for 21 years. Ever since I was old enough to buy cigarettes myself I was a 2+ pack a day smoker. I tried, unsuccessfully,  numerous times over the years to quit. I’ve tried patches, gum, and cold turkey. None of these methods ever lasted more than a week or two and with patches and gum I still smoked cigarettes while using them. On top of that there was the irritability,  anxiety,  sleep loss, and weight gain that usually accompanies trying to quit. About 2 years ago my wife, who had been a smoker as long as me, and I bought a e-cig kit at a mall kiosk. We were excited to try to quit smoking and save money. However, we found the taste unappealing and something about it just did not satisfy the cravings or habits. But it was nice to have a smokeless alternative for when we were around friends and family that didn’t smoke. We tried other brands of cigarette looking e-cigs, but it wasn’t until we were introduced to personal vaporizers and vaping that we found something we  could really latch on to. We went to a local brick and mortar, tried numerous flavored e-juices, found flavors we liked, bought evod starter kits and began our journey to quit the combustion cigarettes that we knew were horrible for us but hadn’t been successful in getting off of…yet. It has now been 10 weeks for me without a cigarette. I had 3 cigarettes day we bought our vaporizers and have not had one since. It was a little harder for my wife, but it has been 7 weeks without a cigarette for her now. I was born with asthma and with smoking many physical activities were difficult for me. In 10 weeks I can now walk up stairs without getting winded and sweating after the first flight. I’m looking forward to being able to walk my dogs and ride a bike again. Food now tastes amazing, but I haven’t put on the weight that I had with other attempts at quiting. I’m sleeping better, my wife says that I don’t snore as much or as loud as I use to, and I am actually dreaming again when I sleep. My house, my car, and myself no longer smell like stale cigarette smoke. In fact the smell of cigarette smoke is now semi – nauseous. I have no doubt that vaping has bettered my life and I believe a big part of this working has been the availability of various flavors and different stenghths of nicotine.

Each of these techniques failed every time, and I went back to smoking. August 2, 2011 I purchased my first electronic cigarette. I have been tobacco free ever since! I am a true believer that the electronic cigarette has made my life so much better. I don’t have the hacky cough that I did when I smoked. I don’t wheeze anymore when I lay down at night. I can run and play with my grandchildren now without gasping for breath, and my Doctor says that my lungs have really improved a lot! Not only does my Doctor approve of my using electronic cigarettes, he is telling other patients that smoke and can’t quit to give e cigs a try. My very best friend had COPD. She loved cigarettes so much and she would tell me that she knew she was killing herself by smoking, but she could not stop (not even to save her life). She was 60 years young. Smoking killed her the last part of August, 2011. This was just a couple of weeks after I started using an electronic cigarette. I honestly believe that if I did not have e cigs, I would go back to smoking. I enjoyed smoking. I enjoyed it so much that I don’t know if I could quit even if I was dying from it. E cigs are giving me the same satisfaction that I got from smoking cigarettes, and at a much lower risk than smoking.",Please let me share my story with you.,http://vaping.info/news/2014/please-let-me-share-my-story-with-you
134,"I was a 30+ yr, 3+ppd smoker.  I tried every method to quit including nrt products, hypnosis, acupuncture, cold turkey, herbal supplements, you name it.  Because of ecigs i totally quit smoking 2/17/10 and haven’t looked back.  I wasn’t thrilled with cigalike products, but the first year i vaped they were the only thing available.  When i discovered hardwired passthroughs and 5 volt, then vv i was thrilled with vaping.  As more liquids became available vaping became a better and better experience.  I, like many others, prefer eliquid that does not taste like tobacco.  Having lost close family to smoking related lung cancer and emphysema i finally feel i have a chance at not suffering their fate.  I always knew that the hand/mouth habit was my biggest hurdle to overcome, because vaping addresses this issue it works for me.  Prior to vaping, any time i attempted to quit in the previous 15 years i had to use an nrt product as i use nicotine therapeutically under physician recommendation and guidance. I have neurological disease which causes tremors and shaking and nicotine greatly reduces the shaking better than any of the numerous pharmaceutical products I’ve tried.  Vaping is much less costly than using nrt products, plus, as with smoking, when I’m shaking more i can vape more. So that vaping helps with both not smoking and symptomatic treatment of the shaking is a great bonus for me.

Since then, I’ve been afraid to try and quit. I’m now 37 and started vaping a few months ago and it allowed me to stop smoking without the severe withdrawal.

137,"Hi I’m Frank from Rialto Ca. I writing this testimonial to let you know how vaping has changed my life. The first time I picked up a cigarette was at the age of 15 years old and believe me when I say this that’s all it took.  By the age of 18 I knew I was addicted to cigarettes because I’d find a way to get them friends or just stole them from my dad. My occupation is a truck driver so for a couple year being on the road that’s how I stayed awake when driving throughout the night. It became a very expensive habit in my early 20’s I was already smoking almost up to 2 1/2 packs a week. My smoking habit then escalated to the point of me having problems with my health, relationship and family but just a year ago I stop hiding and telling lies to my wife and kids about me smoking which is hard to do when the odor is hard to hide and that’s thanks to a friend. He introduced me to vaping and ever since then my relationship with my wife and kids has improved and I feel so much better stress free worry free I mean even my health and the activities I’m able to do. I’m now more active even go to the gym 3-5 times a week which is something I wasn’t able to do a year ago because I would have trouble breathing. I’ve got friends and family to stop smoking and start vaping and its been good knowing that they are making the change and are staying with the change because of how much better they feel. So I may not have to much to say on how it’s changed my life but my wife and kids are my life so if things have changed for good and positive then vaping has changed my life. And to who is reading this VAPING IS NOT A TREND its a way of making a change and I think I “We the People”  have the right to choose what makes us feel better. Now the vape community is no harm to nobody so help us out and do the right thing and save life’s from these big tobacco companies that are in it just for the money and don’t care about the people that have made them who they are.

138,"I started smoking when I was 14 (1998). And finally kicked the habit April 2, 2013. In that 15 year time span I tried: dropping down to ultra light cigs, giving myself only a certain number of cigs a day, chantix (scary stuff, stay away from this) nicotine gum and lozenges, and just going cold turkey. As with most smokers, none of these worked and had just about given up hope. Which was super depressing, I have 2 kids and a beautiful wife, so I kept looking. And a guy at work showed up one day with a gas station ecig. He claimed that it was working for him, so I decided to give it a try. I ordered one and on April 2 2013 it arrived. I had told my wife, who understanbly was skeptical about it working, that once I started vaping I would not smoke, i sure didn’t need another habit. So I finished my last pack that day and started vaping and have not touched a cigarette since then. I know some people have a tough time switching over, but for me it was one of the easiest things I had done. I was determined to not make my kids grow up without a father, so I committed as much as humanly possible to vaping. And since April 2, 2013 I have not had a single cigarette. Of course I’ve long since moved up to bigger and better quality PVs. Those cig a likes only satisfy you for a short while until you need something refillable and much higher quality.  And like with most people since I stopped smoking my taste came back. I’m not as easily winded, my daily coughing stopped long ago, and my wife tells my I have stopped snoring.",My family is why i started vaping,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-family-is-why-i-started-vaping
139,"Hello,
 My name is Jason Griffin. I’d like to write a brief testimonial on how electronic cigarettes have changed my life.
 I was a pack and a half a day smoker (cigarettes) for 14 years. 5 years ago I decided to try out an ecig which were for sale at a kiosk at my local mall here in Georgia. I immediately knew this was a product that might help me kick the habit of smoking. Before trying ecigs, I tried other products on the market geared towards quitting smoking. These products included Welbutrin, Chantix, Nicorette gum, and the patch. None of the products above seemed to control my urge to quit. So therefore, I never did.
 As of today I have completely quit smoking and haven’t smoked in approx 4 years. My first year “vaping” I was off and on with smoking cigarettes, but I soon found myself choosing my ecig over smoking.
 My current nicotine strength is 6mg. I started out at a 24mg strength but decided to slowly wing myself down off such a high nicotine level. In the future I plan on continuing to lower my nicotine levels to 3mg and eventually to 0mg nicotine eliquid.
 Vaping has completely changed my life. I can actually taste my food now. I can now play with my 3 year old without getting “winded”. I don’t smell like an ashtray any longer. My wife doesn’t mind me kissing her…I could go on and on!!!
 As far as the negative results of vaping…well, I honestly couldn’t tell you one negative effect it’s had on me or my life!
 As far as I’m concerned, ECIGS SAVE LIVES, PERIOD!!! Signed,
Jason Griffin

140,"I have been a long time tobacco user for twenty years. I had always enjoyed different products and learning about the history of tobacco and being exposed to tobacco culture. As a younger guy I never gave much thought to what dangers I was exposing myself to or what harm I may be doing to myself until I started to notice small differences in my health and wellness in my early twenties. I smoked throughout my teens and and I also used smokeless tobacco products. I quit smoking around age 22 and began chewing off and on up until my early 30’s.
That was until I had the worst feeling wash over me one day in the E.R. As I sat there waiting to be examined by the doctor I was scared out of my mind.  It wasn’t just the mere thought of having Cancer. It was looking at my almost one year old daughter in that room with a big smile on her face, happy as a clam as I imagined her walking across a stage and being handed a diploma and looking out into the crowd with that same big smile on her face only to see her mom sitting alone next to an empty chair. I then saw her with that same bright smile on her wedding day standing at the alter in a beautiful dress but I wouldn’t be there. I wouldn’t be there for my daughter on the nights she needed a shoulder to cry on, or the days when a proud smile could make all the difference in the world. That day was the day I put down the tobacco and walked away from it for good. Vaping ecigs not only helps me stay away from tobacco, but its become a hobby that I enjoy very much. My clothes don’t smell, I don’t have a bunch of stuff in my teeth, I don’t leave spit cans around and I am no longer worried that I won’t be able to be there for my daughter whenever she needs me. Vaping saved my life and in turn, gave my daughter the ability to have a loving parent in hers. It’s hard to understand what something means to someone if it isn’t drawn out or explained. I just wanted you to know that there IS a safer alternative to tobacco, It can be a helpful tool and a much less harmful means of stress relief, hobby, or habitual cessation. The studies have been done. The proof is out there. Question everything, do your research, keep your eyes open and your chin up. It could save your life.",For Ellie,http://vaping.info/news/2014/for-ellie
141,"I smoked half-a-pack to a pack a day for almost 14 years.  I had attempted to quit on several occasions, but even when I had “quit” I would still sneak a cigarette or two every couple of days, or I would smoke a bowl of shisha in my hookah.  After conversations with a few co-workers who had started vaping, I purchased an ego starter kit.  Three days after receiving this kit, I was able to stop using cigarettes completely. My only use of tobacco in the 8 months since I switched was a single session of shisha smoking.  I have no desire to smoke a traditional cigarette or a hookah now.  I have progressed from my ego kit to mech mods and rebuildable tanks, with progressive satisfaction in my vaping experience. I am able to smell and taste again, and I seem to be snoring less and sleeping better.  I will stand up for the right to vape, and intend to submit comments on the FDA regulation and to my Representative and Senators, as well as state and local politicians.

143,"I was a 2 pack a day smoker at the time I decided to switch to vaping in January of 2013. I had been smoking for 32 years and my health was paying the price. I was using 3 inhalers and had recently been given a nebulizer to provide me with 2 very strong medicines for my lungs. I found myself using those inhalers and the nebulizer so I could smoke a cigarette and then having to go right back to using those items just to breathe. I was a die-hard smoker and felt I was going to die via smoking since nothing I had tried in the past had worked. No medicine, patches, gum, or cold turkey had worked for longer than 3 months before cigarettes took over again and again. I was introduced to e-cigs by a friend whose sister, another heavy smoker, had quit using them. I thought if she could do it surely it would work for me. I bought a starter kit and while waiting for it a carton of cigarettes.  What happened was while vaping the e-cig my smoking decreased by 2/3 immediately. I was completely off cigarettes within two weeks and haven’t smoked since, over 15 months. I have no desire for cigarettes. My breathing is great and I no longer use those inhalers or nebulizer to assist me to breathe. I haven’t had a chest cold or bronchitis the entire time I’ve used e-cigs which was unheard of before using them. I have converted other smokers to vaping and they too have felt the positive effects from vaping. Their breathing has improved 10 fold and they no longer suffer from chest colds or bronchitis. I know them personally so I’m aware of their health conditions. Ecigarettes have saved me from a horrible death and I’ll be forever greatful that they came into my life. I will now be around for my grandchildren and will see them into their teens if not adulthood.

146,"First off, electronic cigarettes ARE NOT tobacco products. So to classify them as such is ridiculous. Not all e-liquid has nicotine. You can choose your nicotine level. And this ridiculous argument about appealing to kids, adults have tastebuds too. We like things that taste good. That is an extremely weak and ridiculous attack. If youre gonna ban/regulate eliquid with flavors, then you mine as well do the same with hundreds of alcohol companies. Vodkas ranging in flavors from fruit, candy, desert, etc…  It’s not marketing to kids, it’s just marketing period! We like things with taste. We all know that the real reason behind all this ridiculousness is that they want us smoking cigarettes, they want us sick, they want us in doctor’s offices and hospital beds, and they want us on meds. Thats it. Thats the real reason. So, because they have nothing, they have to it use the ol ‘marketing to kids’ ploy. It’s all a bunch of ridiculous nonsense. Idk how many times I can say ridiculous in one short story, but it really is………Ugh, anyway I was a tobacco cigarette smoker for 16 + years. I’ve been vaping, and smoke free for over a year now. I feel better, have more energy, dont cough up yellow muckus, sense of smell and taste has significantly increased, my teeth are getting whiter, and I don’t smell like shit.

147,"I’m the kind of guy that knows if I do enough work, have an interest or love, carefully think through and research it, any challenge life throws at me lends the possibility of learning to overcome the difficulties while basking in the rewards.  It was that way in my professional life and various achievements and it has been that way being a musician.  I even did the tremendous amount of work to learn to play the bluegrass banjo well enough to play in my own bluegrass band for the last 13 years.  If you think that is easy to do, try it some time.  I have, through hard work and dedication, “won out” as they say.  Everything, every time. Smoking cigarettes since I was thirteen was the only thing I was not able to overcome.  After trying to quit twice in forty-four years, I was beaten each time I tried to rid myself of my almost three pack a day habit.  It was not without incentive that I failed and refused to try again.  It was because I felt so miserable and made everyone around me feel miserable that I reckoned that it wasn’t worth the “sickness” to put myself and others through that again. Then, last December, 2013, I was very ill.  I had trouble focusing, terrible chills, and trouble breathing.  My wife called the ambulance because I was talking out of my head and was unresponsive.  I blacked out and don’t remember the 32 mile trip to the hospital.  When I awoke, I was in a hospital bed with a nurse saying they had taken a three dimensional x-ray of my chest and they would let me know soon how it came out.  I lay there thinking.  “Oh no. A chest x-ray.”  After gathering what thoughts I could about what was going on, it was as if a light switch went off in my head.  “What ever you are in here for, you aren’t going to be smoking any time soon.  This is it.  Cigarettes probably put you here and they are out of your life now.”  I somehow new smoking for me was over.  But oh my what did that mean?  Pain and suffering?  Addiction battles for the rest of my life? It turned out I was extremely lucky.  My chest x-ray was clear and other than having to battle Influenza A and double pneumonia I was going to be fine.  After a fantastic amount of antibiotic drips and lots of rest and care I left a new man.  Although I knew the battle of quitting smoking was just starting.  The hospital started me on the patch system.  Good thing. The first three days were pretty much a snap.  Unbelievably, I had no withdrawal symptoms.  Then the fourth day started.  It was 24 hours of the worst hell anyone can imagine.  I needed something along with the patches to help me.  I remembered seeing a video about e-cigarettes and how they worked.  I was hesitant to purchase one but I thought to myself if it helps me stay off smoking real cigarettes I need to try it.  I did.  Once I realized I could refill the devices with liquid containing nicotine for me, like my patches were did, and slowly cut down on the nicotine strength of the liquid by purchasing liquids with varied amounts of nicotine and even some liquid with no nicotine at all, I knew I would not ever smoke cigarettes with tobacco in them again. It has now been four months and I am still not smoking cigarettes.  I vape.  By inhaling the vapor from these systems (I have tried quite a few different kinds and sizes) I know without a doubt I will make it.  I am a non-smoker and will stay that way.  I have cut my nicotine levels way, way down through the help of the ability to mix tobacco flavored e liquid with varied amounts of nicotine.  Some day I will reach zero nicotine and that will be the end of nicotine in my life.  I know in my heart this will happen. I am concerned that the part of the FDA regulations dealing with e liquid may hinder my ability to stay off tobacco cigarettes.  I need to be able to get the variety of e liquid I am currently able to purchase.  Only for a while.  My goal is zero nicotine in my life.",My thoughts on vaping.,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-thoughts-on-vaping

149,"I started smoking in 1975, at the tender age of not-quite-14.  Throughout the last 39 years, I tried 4 times to quit smoking, with very little success: in 1984, a cold-turkey attempt lasted 3 months, before I could not stand the suffering another minute and started smoking again; in 1987, I became pregnant with my son, and tried very hard to quit smoking, but succeeded only in cutting down to 3 or 4 cigarettes a day.  In the following years, I tried twice more, using the patch, and neither attempt lasted much more than a week before I could not stand it another minute, and went back to smoking.  I can attest from personal experience that “the patch” simply does not work, because simply replacing the nicotine is merely the smallest fraction of what is required to make a non-smoker out of a smoker. By January of 2014, I had lost all hope of ever quitting cigarettes, despite having watched my father die of lung cancer in 2006, and had no interest whatever in the suffering which I believed was required in order to quit smoking.  However, we were in the middle of the coldest winter in 30 years, and as an outdoors-only smoker, I was sick of freezing to death just to satisfy my habit, so I became interested in electronic cigarettes — e-cigarettes.  None of the drugstore disposables I tried — Fin, Njoy, and Blu — were even slightly tolerable, so I grew angry enough at the weather and my stupid habit and those extremely lame e-cigarettes, and went to Google, to find more information about e-cigarettes; what I discovered was a whole new world. At the ECF, the Electronic Cigarette Forum, I began learning about all the many kinds of hardware, from the small, cigarette-like true “e-cigarette” to the larger and much more powerful personal vaporizer “mod,” as well as all the different vendors of both those devices and the nicotine “juice” which is used in them.  Starting around the 1st of February 2014, using one of the “cig-a-like” devices on a regular basis, my smoking declined from about 15-20 per day to just 2 or 3, and by the end of February the actual cigarettes tasted so extremely, bitterly foul to me, that on February 27 I smoked my last, and on February 28, 2014, I enjoyed my first smoke-free 24 hours in 39 years, savoring my e-cigarette and barely noticing the lack of cigarettes. NO ONE can tell me that e-cigarettes don’t work for quitting smoking, because THEY ABSOLUTELY DO, I don’t care what the American Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, or any other paid flunkies of Big Pharma have to say about it — those “charitable” organizations receive hundreds of thousands of dollars every year from Big Pharma, so naturally Big Pharma’s agenda is their own, despite those organizations’ noble-sounding names and publicly-stated agendas, of wanting everyone to quit smoking — what they really want is for the pharmaceutical-supported gravy-train to continue, so they will naturally say anything that Big Pharma pays them to say.  I publicly defy them to refute that!  Stop taking Big Pharma’s money!  SPEAK THE TRUTH!  E-CIGARETTES SAVE LIVES by ACTUALLY helping people quit smoking!  E-cigarettes do not kill people — as Chantix does!  E-cigarettes are not a useless waste of time, money, hope, and effort — as patches and pills and unsupported behavioral therapy are!  ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE THE BEST WAY TO QUIT SMOKING THAT HAS EVER BEEN INVENTED. Period. I am one who has quit, even without an initial objective of quitting.  E-CIGARETTES WORK, and they do not cost a fortune, unlike every single thing that Big Pharma has ever pushed on the public.  Modern drug-lords do not wear “bling” and hang about on street-corners; they wear suits and ties and hang around on Wall Street, in country clubs, and in exclusive restaurants, between trips to the bank.  To quote Don Henley: “A man with a briefcase can steal more money than any man with a gun.”  But Big Pharma is not just stealing money:  they’re stealing LIVES, with their evil, mercenary stance that “e-cigarettes are dangerous and don’t work.”  E-cigarettes are NOT dangerous, they’re not nearly as expensive as EVERYTHING from Big Pharma, and they DO work.  I smoked for 39 years before I found e-cigarettes, and I am living proof.",E-Cigarettes DO Work!,http://vaping.info/news/2014/e-cigarettes-do-work

Quitting smoking is the hardest thing to do in the world and electronic cigarettes has let me beat that nasty habit. I feel now I will live longer and be their for my wife and kids. My father died of lung issues when I was 20. He working in the coal mines and potash mines and as well smoked for years and years. You would have thought that I would have quit along time ago but I did with no prevail. They say nicotine is bad and that as well im trying to quit.

151,"My experience is more rare than most. My interest lies with my career and job creation, more than vaping itself. I graduated from college in 2010. I started vaping in December 2009. After graduating, I moved from New York to North Carolina to pursue a career. I was unemployed for almost 6 months, searching 10 hours per day, 7 days a week for jobs. Not jobs in my field; any job. I was living off of a rapidly depleting graduation gift from my family, which was about $6000. I finally landed a job at a local supermarket. I was a college graduate making $9 an hour at 32 hours per week. For almost 2 years, I was living on tap water and ramen noodles, and living in a cheap apartment in a rough part of town. During this period, I was unable to quit smoking. The only vaping products I had access to were cig-a-likes, which were not enough for me. Eventually I saved enough money for an eGo-style setup, which still was not enough to help me quit. It wasn’t until I bought my first high-voltage mod that I achieved the vaping experience I needed, and I’ve been 100% smoke-free for almost 3 years. Keep in mind, I wasn’t trying to quit. I enjoyed smoking. I knew it was bad for me and I didn’t care. But, because of the endless variety of flavors and devices, vaping turned into more of a hobby for me. It became the insatiable quest for more vapor. After being depressed for nearly 2 years due to my college degree that didn’t mean anything to employers and my low pay and impoverished lifestyle, a job became available at my local vape shop. I was interviewed and hired on the spot, and it was one of the happiest days of my life. I was able to go into work and give my manager my 2 week’s notice. I started working at the vape shop shortly after, and after only 3 months, I was the manager of one of their retail stores. About 5 months after that, I was again promoted, this time to the offices/warehouse as Product Development Manager, where I work presently. I’m in charge of researching new products and keeping my company on the cutting-edge of this rapidly evolving market. And that brings us to today. I’m worried. With these new FDA regulations, I’m uncertain if I’ll have a job tomorrow. This regulation is going to stop innovation in its tracks and make my job obsolete. I have enough money to pay the bills, but not enough to save. If either my girlfriend or I lose our jobs, we will be forced to break the lease on our apartment, sell one of our cars and live out of a cardboard box. I’m trying to create a future for myself and my girlfriend. We want to get married, have children and live the good old American Dream. Unfortunately, our own government is turning that dream into a nightmare. The proposed legislation and lengthy, expensive fees will put my company, and every other company, out of business. We have over 5000 products. How can we be expected to submit applications, at about $10 Million apiece, for each and every one of these products? Nobody can afford that….except for Big Tobacco. They have 2 flavors, 3 nicotine strengths. That’s a total of 6 applications they will be required to submit, and the cost won’t even make a dent for them. People talk about our $2 Billion industry like it’s just one company. It’s not. It’s hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses that employ average people that just want to make an honest living. I have worked extremely hard to get where I am today. I’m not a fat-cat. I make $35,000 per year. I just want enough money to have a decent house and raise a family. Every day, the outlook gets bleaker. I can’t see any point in the foreseeable future where I will have enough money to make my dream a reality. I don’t have any other marketable skills. I know vaping and I love vaping. It’s not as if I can switch to a different industry, because vaping is so unique. If the proposed ruling gets passed, it will destroy my future. And my life, because I will go back to smoking. Vaping has allowed me, and many family members and friends, to quit smoking. It has provided me with a career, rather than just a job to pay the bills. It offers me a chance to have a wife and family. I honestly have no idea where else I could get a job with my skills. The only option that would work is to go back to the supermarket, and that is not an option. I would rather work at McDonald’s. So there you have it. Vaping has changed my life. It has gotten me to quit smoking without even trying. It gave me a job, then a career path, and the hope of one day living the American Dream. And now, the American government is coming to take the American Dream away from me. Just as a side note, I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Art in 2010. I searched high and low for almost 3 years to find a job related to my field. I don’t have enough work experience. I am un-hireable. In this day and age, finding a job is about 2 things: work experience and who you know. I don’t know anyone that can get me a job, and as I said, I have no work experience. I don’t have money saved up to where I can work a non-paid internship. I need to get paid. My particular situation may be unique, but I want to give you a real person’s concerns about FDA regulation. There are millions of people that found a place in the world because of the vaping industry. Small businesses are popping up all over the place. All these people will soon find themselves with nowhere to turn. Others may have former colleagues that can help find them jobs, or may have had a career in another field before determining that vaping was a better option, career-wise. For me, that is not the case at all. You are hearing from someone that could not find a job fresh out of college in any field other than retail. I was no better than a high-school dropout, except I had student loans to pay. This proposed rule will ruin many small businesses and careers, and in my case, it will even destroy lives and livelihood. I hope this does not fall on deaf ears, because I honestly feel helpless. I feel like nothing I say will make a difference and that my own fate is completely out of my hands. How can anyone possibly feel this way in the so-called “Land of the Free”?",My Vaping Experience,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-vaping-experience-3

When I was little I vowed I’d never smoke, but I ended up being a smoker despite that vow. I began smoking in the 8th grade, I started smoking heavily at age 16. I’ve quit more times than I can remember, but I always went back. I started vaping in November 5th 2013. I have been cigarette free since November 12th 2013. Vaping has saved my life, and had allowed me to spend more time with my family.

154,"I started smoking Newports at 15 years old. It was the cool thing to do. I never bought a pack then, just had one socially here and there. That turned into buying packs and before I know it, I smoked a pack a day. That was in 1995. Fast forward to Oct of 2013. I had had enough enough of cigarettes but had no idea how to stop. I tried all the things my home state (NYS) had to offer. The patch, the gum, hypnosis, you name it I tried it. I tried an ecig and I wasn’t really sold on the taste at first but it kept the cravings at bay. It is now April 2014 and I haven’t had a cigarette since that day in Oct and I have no desire to go back. The ecig has not only helped me kill my 20 year expensive cigarette habit but I take in considerably less nicotine than before. I started ecigs using ejuice that was 24mg nicotine per ml. I am now using juice that is only 6mg/ml. That is a considerable drop and I play to kill the nic altogether.

158,"I started smoking when I was 13 years old. I started at first on menthol cigarettes and the smoked marlboros for the 7 years. I first heard about e-cigarettes (a name I hate) about 7 months ago. I first tried the cigarette look a likes (which are the only true ecig, IMHO) and tried it, I didnt much care for it but thought to give it my best effort. I eventually found out about the other more advanced types called PV (personal vaporizers) and the different flavors I could use. I finally started gaining ground and getting away from tobacco and now I have been smoke free for 5 months plus and have been decreasing the nicotine levels as well. Now I know that some people see the bigger “ecigs” and think that they are ridiculous but in reality its no different than someone with a big cell phone, bigger than it needs to be yes, but you get better options and results. It makes me sad to see that people are trying to get in the way of something that while it may not be 100% risk free is still multitudes better than traditional cigarettes. I think most people forget personal vaporizers and ecigs are meant to be an alternative to smoking. What blows my mind is that the tobacco industry has been killing millions and instead of taking it off the shelf, people have decided to attack something that while not proven to bee 100% safe has been proven to be safer by leaps and bounds compared to cigarettes. My father is 58 years old and recently had the same experience as I have. He tried Chantix and other drugs, which caused him to be very depressed and we were very worried about him. Yet those are under almost no scrutiny. He tried ecigs and his doctors say his lung function has improved his blood pressure is better and in general he is healthier.

160,"i started when i was in high school, i never really thought much of it until i started to figure out that it was an addiction than just a fun thing to do with friends. ive tried to cut back and limit my cigarettes a day but i always ended up giving up. id say that “this will be the last pack” but i could never do it. then i found out about vaping. im the type of person that looks into everything before i use it and know the risks involved and everything outweighed the risks of dying by smoking. i was able to easily stop smoking within a couple of days and ive never felt better. i can breathe again, food tastes good, i drink a ton of water when i used to never since you need to stay hydrated while vaping, i dont smell, i dont have to go outside every half an hour. even with vaping, i can go without it for a lot longer than i used to be able to with smoking, i used to lay in bed about to go to sleep then i got that feeling that i needed a cig and went outside and was wide awake again, and it would just keep happening…with vaping i can easily not vape for hours before i have to go to bed since im not addicted to all the other alkaloids within tobacco. i have been able to cut back on my nicotine intake since vaping lets you be really specific on how much nicotine you want in your juice, eventually ill be able to cut it to 0 and just do this as a fun hobby. i have an addictive personality and the whole community and hobby behind vaping is something that keeps my mind off cigs. why would someone want to take that away from me or anyone else that wants to quit? shouldnt people be HAPPY that theres millions of people getting off tobacco? this should be celebrated, not banned and regulated",the only thing that works,http://vaping.info/news/2014/the-only-thing-that-works

162,"50 years of smoking 2 packs a day…  multiple “cut back” attempts with nicotine gum and patch were unsuccessful. I never intended to totally quit smoking.  Intended to continue smoking all my life, but just cut back somewhat.   Then I did research on “e-cigarettes”, mainly through reading the E-cigarette Forum online.  I skipped trying “cig-alikes” and went straight to using the bigger battery devices with cartomizers and tanks.   Immediately I was able to actually stop smoking conventional cigarettes.  No cravings whatsoever for a regular cigarette.   I credit the flavors of the e-liquids, the continuance of my hand-to-mouth habit, and the appearance of the harmless vapor I exhaled with my success in stopping smoking entirely, even though that was not my goal.   Imagine that! Substituting vaping for smoking has improved my life in that I no longer have a smoker’s cough and no longer reek of tobacco.  My home and car are cleaner too, with no more scattered ashes, smell of stale ashtrays, or accumulation of cigarette smoke residues on walls and surfaces. I expected to simply “cut back” on my smoking, but the better taste of the sweet tasting flavored e-liquids I find I prefer made it a piece of cake (no pun intended!) for me to switch completely to using e-cigarettes instead. Despite the hyped up scare stories in the media about nicotine, I thoroughly researched “nicotine” and found that the benefits (when NOT accompanied by burning tobacco) are many.  Better ability to concentrate, better memory, possible delay of Alzheimer’s, just for a few.   I also found out the proportions of nicotine in the e-liquids I buy are not hazardous to me if spilled on my skin.    In sum, vaping is far healthier for me, cleaner, and more pleasant in every respect than smoking ever was.  Regardless of how late in life I made the switch, vaping has definitely improved my life.",My Testimony,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-testimony-7
163,"I started smoking Djarims clove cigarettes when I was 14 years old. Later in my teens I moved to Marlboro reds. Fast forward 17 plus years and I had a virtually unbroken habit of smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day.  I started to question my habit in my mid twenties. I saw the tobacco stains on my fingers. The smell always lingered no matter how much I washed my hands. My gingivitis had receded my gums a bit and my teeth were yellowing. My sense of taste and smell were severely limited. My clothing smelt of burnt tobacco and ash. I was very self conscious of how I smelled around others. I hated the tobacco flakes in my pockets and in my home. And the ash was always present. Always. In my hair, my carpet, in my car, and my clothing.  The stigma was pretty debilitating as well. I was a social out caste. My family always made rude remarks. In public people shamed me with rude and persistent comments and passive aggressive coughing. Smoking was typecast as something lazy or dirty people do. Employers where always suspicious of myself and fellow smokers as we went on our smoke breaks. We where to engage our smoking habit in the open without any shelter or roof and almost never any ashtray. Marching at a quick step to get to an approved smoking area took up most of the break time leaving only a couple of precious minutes to suck down a cigarette and run back to work.  I heard of vaping. I had tried horribly marketed and produced products like Blue or Vue. They tasted horrible. The vapor production was nonexistent. The cartridges where just as expensive if not more expensive than cigarettes. And somehow every single time I tried their products I got headaches. I gave up on vaping. It was a fad or a niche. I have tried gum and lozenges to help quite or reduce. They tasted horrible. And the nicotine going into my stomach caused acid reflux. I tried patches. As a man who works physical labor the patches always fell off within 10 minutes of working. I even tried using bands and gauze to hold the patches in place. It never worked. And for all  these smoking cessation aids they caused nightmares.  I heard of vaping yet again. This time through a website known as Reddit.com in the e_cigarette forums. I tried a different approach after asking questions. I located a local brick and mortar shop and purchased a 1800 mah Ego Twist battery and a clearomizer tank. After sampling e-juices I settled on vanilla 50/50 PG VG blend with 18 mg nicotine. I was simply amazed. How was it a billion dollar company like RJ Reynolds could not make a product work but a company like Kangertech could? The difference was literally night and day. I found good quality equipment with a great quality e-juice. After quitting smoking cigarettes cold turkey I am happy to say I have not had a single cigarette in 2 months. Where big pharmaceutical and tobacco companies had failed me, these Asian designed/derived products excelled. The difference vaping has made for me is massive. I no longer am out casted to run outside for a vape. I can kiss my fiance without fear of ashtray breath. I can smell. I can taste. And, most importantly, I can breath! I don’t litter cigarette butts on the ground anymore. Ash is no longer covering myself and my personal effects. The annoying tobacco flakes are no longer haunting my pockets or my dyers lint trap. And the general public does not castrate me socially because I have a nicotine habit in public. My bosses and my family don’t make rude comments. In fact I’ve received quite a bit of encouragement! When I interact with people they no longer recoil in disgust from my cigarette smell.  I have read countless times peoples anecdotal evidence and I have to say I completely agree. After reviewing a basic summary of the new FDA language I am highly disappointed. While at first glance it seems like a positive move for a Federal agency to regulate basic safety guidelines for consumer protection there is more language that is far more ominous. This statement and document released is really nothing more than an effort to rally a very large consumer base back over to companies such as RJ Reynolds. This has nothing to do with consumer protection and everything to do with marketing and money. The very agency tasked with providing us safe regulations for us consumers is the same agency swashed with contribution monies and lobbying by pharmaceutical and tobacco companies. it can be seen in histories past established companies discrediting new technologies. Reference Edison and Tesla in the AC versus DC electrical distribution public relations wars. Or automobile versus diesel companies. Or even now as we speak the established energy generation companies versus renewable/solar companies.  This is not about public safety, its about a public relations war to sway by proxy or regulatory force a large consumer base back into a large market. This is simply about the FDA being as of yet discovered buy out to force people back into a virtual monopoly or oligopoly.   I support the vaping community. I will continue to do so.

The FDA has presented no evidence that vaping is more harmful than cigarettes.  Evidence does exists, however, that vaping is much safer and lacks carcinogens.

I tryed every single of the NRTs on the market, going back to smoking each time, I tryed cold turkey a few times over the years but went back to smoking, the drugs for quiting were out of the question, they are way to dangerous.  I worked in a pharmacy and was certified in smoking cessation counseling. Even with that knowledge it didnt help me.  I had pretty well resigned my self to the fact I would die smoking.

172,"I smoked unfiltered cigarettes heavily, starting at age 11 stealing grandma’s Pal Mal’s out of her pack when she wasn’t looking. I have always been in decent shape but by the time I was 27 I was a long haul trucker and after spending most of my days sitting there driving and chain smoking, well I would sound winded after walking up a long flight of stairs and couldn’t breathe very well and people would ask if I was ok after I did these things or try and run a block. It was bad….In May 2013 it got worse when I had an accident at work…I fell off a warehouse dock, landing on my back and arm causing nerve damage in my elbow and spine. I lost some of my fine motor control, I still randomly drop things and had to stop playing guitar. I couldn’t work and am still on light duty and living on credit cards…. Four months after the injury life was pretty bleak, I was going threw a divorce as well and the last thing on my mind was quitting smoking or anything positive for that matter. Then, in a last ditch effort to at least slow my smoking down and think about taking care of myself, my mother gave me a couple Ego E-cigarettes in August 2013 for my 30th birthday. I had tried those cheap gas station ones before and didn’t see the hype compared to the harsh smoke of an unfiltered Camel….but these were different. These E-cigarettes tasted more like tobacco should and the vapor had a throat hit to it I thought I could get used to. I immediately fell in love with vaping and on September first, 2013 I smoked my last cigarette. But it didn’t stop with just smoking, it gave me a new hobby to fill the void of loosing my music. It was tough at first learning to wrap my own heating coils and mix my own liquids…there were spills and many finger pricks and intense moments of wanting to give up. But with tools like “helping hands” and tupperware to contain spills I overcame my new injuries and it gave me something to live for and be passionate about….I now spend my spare time not at work and physical therapy making liquid for my friends and customizing their personal vaporizing equipment and showing them the good side of vaping….I send emails and make calls and help protect vapor’s rights….I love it when someone on the street walks up to me and asks about my e-cigarette and if I really know what’s in it and reply “yes, because I made it myself.” The look on their face is priceless and rewarding as I walk away knowing I might have impacted their life or given them information to pass on to a smoker they know…who knows. This is something that didn’t just get me to quit smoking, it saved me from self pity and depression and gave me a passion and I want to pay it forward and share with others all the wonderful things vaping has done for me. It’s not just about quitting smoking, it’s about making positive changes and doing better for yourself and possibly helping others. As I sit here writing this, still recovering and in the worst shape of my life, I still breathe easier because of vaping. And I know that the others I’ve got to put down cigarettes and give it a try and the joy of being free from cigarettes and everything else it’s done for me….it’s one of the most rewarding things I’ve got to enjoy in life. And I just wish others could know the difference it’s made…because I had given up on quitting smoking, I had accepted my fate as a smoker….and now I know there is something there that makes it so I don’t have to live that way.

I am now 36 and have not used tobacco in over a year..I love vaping and the strong community of people within that have come together under this life saving cause. Over regulation of this product will only mean that it will be harder to get these life saving products out to people and big tobacco will be handed the industry on a silver platter. This makes me sick to my stomach.. we as vapers dispise big tobacco and want nothing to do with them let alone have to buy vaping supplies from them.. please just stay out of our vaping industry we have been regulating it well enough without the fda help… also it is not a tobacco product.. sorry…. so why dont you do the people of America a favor and stay out of this one,My testimony,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-testimony-5

180,"I smoked for 23 years and smoked about a pack to a pack and a half a day, more on weekends when out socializing with friends. I tried quitting several times, once cold turkey which didn’t even last a week. Another time I had used the patch and all that did was make me anxious. The lozenge came out and I decided to give that a try and it worked for some time until that gave me stones in my saliva glands and had to stop using the lozenge I had also tried the gum which also failed.  I had basically given up on quitting smoking until I discovered Electronic Cigarettes and after some research online and I bought a starter pack at my local Walgreens store. That was back in April of 2012 and it is now April of 2014 I have not looked back. I feel wonderful, I don’t get out of breath climbing a flight of stairs my doctors have never seen me healthier. I don’t get sick like I used to (once every 3 months) my doctors consider me consider me a non-smoker.  My favorite flavors are anything bakery related. Banana Nut Bread, Rice Crispy Treats and Vanilla. If it weren’t for those types of flavors I don’t think I would have been able to quit smoking. They don’t know the long term effects of vaping but we do know the long term effects of smoking tobacco cigarettes and that is Cancer and Death. Some claim that candy flavors or any other flavor other than tobacco flavors attract children. That is just a lie, if children use these products it’s not because of the candy flavors it’s because of poor parenting nothing more.",Smoke and Stench Free and Loving it,http://vaping.info/news/2014/smoke-and-stench-free-and-loving-it

183,"Before I found vaping I smoked two pack of cigarettes everyday for 14 years. I hated smoking. I tried everything to quit Chantix, Gum, Patch, Gum & patch at the same time, Hypnosis you name it I tried it more than once. Nothing worked for me or my wife. I started vaping 3 years ago and haven’t had a cigarette since. I am 40 years old and I can breath again. I can play with my kids without feeling like I am going to die. When I started vaping I liked it because I could use different flavors daily. Why would anyone trying to quit smoking want to smoke something that tasted like tobacco. I don’t think companies market to kids because of having bubble gum flavors. Adults like bubblegum too and many other flavors. Adults eat candy and ice cream too. People who know nothing about the issues try to make rules because “They just don’t know the long term effects” Well we know the long term effects of smoking tobacco and that is death. Adults in America should have a choice in what they do. People who vape and have been vaping know that there health and wellbeing are better than ever. Kids smoke, do drugs, have sex, skip school….Kids will do what ever they want to do and if this is a campaign to keep kids off vaping then that should be up to the parents to raise there kids right.

After 3years of washing my hands after every cig , chewing gum or brushing my teeth to get rid of the smell , arguing with my girlfriend whenever smelled it or saw me smoke one.

After not smoking for about a month, I realized I had more energy.  So, I got myself a road bicycle and started riding. Had no idea that a week later I would be riding it 16+ miles each ride with ease.  That lead to watching what I eat. I have now lost over 65 pound.  All because I started vaping.

190,"I would like to briefly share my story with you and my concern with the recently released FDA Deeming Regulations pertaining to ‘Vaping’ products (a/k/a electronic cigarettes). I smoked tobacco cigarettes for 36 years (started in the Air Force).  While advised to quit by my doctor, I was unsuccessful after multiple attempts.  I tried all available products including gums, patches, inhalers, books, hypnosis, drugs and “cold turkey”.  Unfortunately none of these methods worked for me.  I did succeed in quitting on August 28th, 2013 after purchasing a higher quality vaping device and some non-tobacco flavored e-liquids.  I was able to quit tobacco cigarettes in about 4 weeks.  I am now almost 8 months tobacco free with no desire to be anywhere near tobacco and cigarettes.  I never really thought that this would happen but am so happy that it did. I started a YouTube channel to help others looking to get off of tobacco cigarettes and to date have helped several dozen people (directly or indirectly) to achieve the same success and quit smoking.  I am very proud of that.  Their success is my success. While I support regulation and standards for the e-cigarette industry, and certainly endorse age restrictions, I am concerned that the products that are most efficient to help people like me quit smoking may be placed in jeopardy.  The higher end devices are more effective than the “cig-a-likes” (those that resemble an actual cigarette). I wanted to share my story with you as a person who was never going to give up tobacco cigarettes but who actually succeeded in making the switch to a reduced harm alternative.

192,"I started smoking when i was 15 , my mother smoked , grandparents , etc etc i thought it was so cool , so adult . I ended up smoking a pack and a half a day for eighteen years .along the way i tried to quit many times , ive tried the gum , the patch , even just sheer will , and i wasnt strong enough . Near the end , i would wake up to my new morning routine of coughing so very violently that i would spend the rest of the day with a headache . I was scared that something larger was at work here , i feared that i had damaged my lungs to the point of no return . I felt helpless , already warned by the coronary disease that runs in my family , the circulation problems i was having in my hands it still didnt deter me from smoking . In 2012 , i found out i was going to be a father , to show my wife support (also a smoker ) i quit when she did , it lasted about 2 weeks , not only was i let down by my inability to stand tough and show support to my wife , i had also started using other tobacco products like dip and snuff fooling myself into believing it made things easier . I knew i didnt want to smoke or even smell like smoke around my daughter , but felt so powerless . I had a friend at a popular weekly podcast who was always talking about his ecig and how it worked for him , so 3weeks  before my daughter was born my wife bought me a starter kit available at most liquor stores .though it was a very basic kit , it took one puff to know that it was a very viable substitue , not perfect , but viable . The concern i initially had was the cost , it was a very expensive system to keep purchasing prefilled cartridges for . So with a little research i jumped into the world of medium level ? Vaping , tanks and cartos and such . within 2 weeks my morning coughing fits were gone , in 2months i noticed my lungs were clearer and my numbness in my hands was gone . In 6 months my sense of smell came back so hard that while driving on the freeway i was thinking i was having car trouble , i wasnt , i now was able to smell that a car somewhere in front of me was haha . In december , it will be 2 years since ive quit smoking , i have taken a drag on a cig just to try and figure out what the big deal was for me , and it tastes vile , being in close quarters with my coworkers who still smoke just blows me away that i used to smell like that , and had no idea. Ive lowered my nicotine level to 6mg and really could put the vaping thing down with ease , sometimes going many many hours without it , and while i did have thoughts of my charliegirl pushing me not to fail this time , i mean it , I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN STRONG ENOUGH TO QUIT SMOKING WITHOUT VAPING , AND WITH THE WAY MY HEALTH WAS GOING , I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN HERE TODAY . I feel , my way of giving back to the community of vaping , is to help educate my friends and family that are interested in becoming an ex smoker through vaping . I truly feel that every little bit of knowledge i can hand out just might be saving a life , at the very least changing it so much for the better .

I was a 38 year 3pack a day smoker of cigarettes.  I had the beginning of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).  I had a Heart attack and 5heart stents but didn’t quit UNTIL: I broke my leg in January and required two screws and surgery. Two months later, It was not healed at all.  March 11 the doctor told me I had to stop smoking immediately so I did cold turkey then I found Vaping.  I get my nicotine at lower levels than cigarettes and will know Today April 25, 2014 if it has helped.  I do know I feel better, I can breathe, smell and no more smokers cough.   I am no longer killing myself and others by smoking.  While I support the Under 18 rule, most websites that sell vaping stuff make you put in your birthday and click if you are over or under 18.  My local Brick and Mortars requires ID if you look young.  If you want to quit you have an alternative to patches that don’t work or medicines that don’t work.  Vaping is healthier than anything out there. Stop making us pariahs.  As you did while we were smokers.
Note: I just returned from Doctor MY leg is now healing.  He was introduced to my Vaping and is pleased it is NOT cigarettes.  He says the only way I avoided bone grafts on my broken leg is by stopping smoking and vaping helped that.  I could have never walked again.

195,"Hi my name is Susan Barnes.  I am an ex-smoker and a current vaping advocate.  I smoked analog cigarettes for over 30 years and I will tell you that quitting is easy, I done it a hundred times, staying quit was my problem.  I once quit for 6 years, but like most smokers when I hit a high stress time, or emotional time I turned to my comfort zone, the analog cancer stick. I had a lot of perfect reasons to quit.  My Dad died in 2003 of COPD and had smoked most of his life.  I have always suffered from bronchitis during the winter and asthma and allergies but was this ever enough to get me to quit, I enjoyed smoking and that was that.  Until May 1, 2013. I would say that my husband and I were fairly heavy smokers, he smoked 1.5 to 2 packs a day and I would smoke over 1 pack a day.  On a regular basis I would hear him say “we have to quit smoking” I knew that would last at the most 6 hours, but then I saw him come home with stuff he got at the local vape shop.  I sat back and watched him play with the ego batteries and juice and see him get frustrated with it so he would go back on the internet and do more research.  One weekend I was in Logan UT for a National clogging competition for my niece and got a phone call asking me to pick him up a mod from a company there that he was sure would make it better for him.  I brought it home and he hasn’t picked up an analog since.  OK I inherited the ego stuff and was doing OK with it I was just going to use it to quit smoking, then dang him he had me trying different juices and mods now I am a….*gasp* vapor. I have got to say yup our health has improved we can taste more, and we breathe better.  I get annoyed when I hear “but you are really still smoking”, this caused me to get involved with research on the health benefits of e-cigs, which then caused me to find out more about FDA and legislations about them.  Now on a normal basis I am an activist, I used to be a card carrying member of the Snake River Alliance (yes a tree hugger), I have been active in the Idaho Democratic party (I know what a lost cause) so when I found out that big government wants to keep me from doing something that has saved my life I found myself getting involved in CASAA and sending my Congressmen, City Councilmen, and Newspapers letters to keep them out of my vaping rights.",My Vaping experience,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-vaping-experience

Then, I was looking on the internet and saw an ad for Blu e cigarettes. I ordered a starter kit. I used that for about a week, but the vapor production was not enough to curb my cravings for a cigarette. I inevitably began smoking again. Then I started looking at you tube videos of “vapers” reviewing e cigarettes and giving  tutorials. I took one of the reviewer’s advice on which product to try. I went to a newly opened electronic cigarette store in a neighboring city. It was the day after Christmas and I had given myself the best gift. I had quit smoking.

198,"My workplace which is comprised of several city blocks is banning all e-cigs and vaporizers.  In August of 2013 my brother introduced me to a vaporizer.  I purchased one simply to placate my brother with no intention what-so-ever of quitting cigarettes as I had tried all the doctor prescribed remedies, hypnotism and support groups to no avail.  I was immediately taken by the vaporizer as it allowed me to get my nicotine fix, simulate smoking and I truly thought that perhaps there is hope for me yet.  At first I would occasionally smoke a traditional cigarette when extremely stressed  or my Mod was malfunctioning and I did not beat myself up about it. I rationalized that I have been a smoker for 30+ years and didn’t get to where I was overnight so it wasn’t realistic to think I would totally sustain overnight either.  Still I am amazed at how easy I went from 3 sometimes 4 packs a day to a pack a week to an occasional cigarette in a very short time.  Whereas I use to smoke traditional cigarettes throughout the day at work (outside at the designated location) I now Vape and have given up cigarettes.  Within a couple of weeks my sense of smell improved.  I was breathing much,much better and I can taste food and do not use as much salt and seasoning. I do not smell like cigarette smoke and I can honestly say I know of no negative side effects outside slight panic when my Mod or tank isn’t working properly.  Unfortunately though I am now faced with the real possibility of losing my job or being forced into retirement as my workplace has issued a smoking ban and redefined smoking to include e-cigs and all vapor emitting devices.  Perhaps I am not the average smoker and this shouldn’t affect me as it has but I am truly concerned.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will sneak around to use to my Mod.  I had a very traumatic and abusive childhood and smoking has always been my keep it together drug of choice.  I have seen mental health counselors and they often prescribe anti-depressants which make me feel sluggish and disrupt my ability to function as needed for my job.   So, nicotine is my coping mechanism for work and life related stress.  I’m sure many non-smokers would say walk it off, exercise, take doctor prescribed medications, find other ways to cope but unless they can go back to early childhood and rewire my central nervous system to not respond a million and one triggers I would ask that they be thankful I found a way to manage my difficulties and still be a productive, working member of society and that reduces harm to me and anyone around me.  I am looking into legal remedies for my situation but it may be cost prohibitive.  I am asking any and all with a legal background to find a constitutional remedy for the vaping bash sweeping across the world.  I would certainly join and support a class action suit brought on behalf of the vaping community and I’m sure many others would as well.  The pockets are deep when you consider all the smaller bans taking place across the country based on the opinions of small groups of city council or workplace board members.   It is too much monetarily for the individual to take on alone and I’m sure that’s what regulators are counting on.",Vaping,http://vaping.info/news/2014/vaping

200,"To Whom It May Concern: I am writing this letter in response to the FDA proposed regulations on e-cigarettes.  I understand that we need some regulations on e-cigs such as prohibiting the sale to minors and listing the addictive nature of nicotine on products.  However, I do not agree with the expensive application process that may be mandatory for all e-cig companies. Vaping saved my life and my boyfriend’s life.  He was a pack a day smoker for 10+ years and was diagnosed with cancer. Vaping helped him kick the dirty habit and he has been cancer free and smoke free for 9 months.  In my opinion, vaping is nothing different than when someone uses nicotine gum or a nicotine patch in order to quit smoking.  In fact, nicotine gum has 20 more ingredients than the juice used to vape.  It’s even more effective in my opinion, because it allows him to continue to get the satisfaction of smoking, without the 400+ chemicals that are in cigarettes.  Now that we are “vapers”, we no longer crave a cigarette.  Vaping is a reduced harm method to quit smoking, besides abstaining nicotine all together. Our smell and taste is better, we breathe better, and we have a more fulfilling life.   The vaping community has become our family.  Through our vaping experience, we have met many small companies who produce products to vape with.  These companies make a living off producing high quality juice to place in our e-cigarrettes or create devices to vape with.  By making these businesses have to comply with a lengthy, expensive application process, their business will shut down.  This application process will force many businesses to close down and people to lose their jobs, forcing many people to return to smoking cigarettes.   I ask that you please consider this and use your power to prevent the application process into going into effect.  If an application were needed to prove that vaping products are safe, that would be understandable by all.  However, most of these small businesses do not have the money that big tobacco companies have and will not be able to comply if it costs thousands of dollars to get their products approved.  Vaping is saving lives all together, and the vaping community is proof.   I appreciate you taking the time to read my letter and hope you will stand behind us.

Not because I’m making money but because I truly feel like I’m helping someone out. In our shop we contently get people coming in just because they want to tell us that they are completely off cigarettes and that they quit vaping as well. As far as the tasty flavors are concerned, don’t get me wrong we all like the taste of them but it is more than that, the variety of flavors allow people to get further away from the habit of smoking. As they go down in nicotine they also shy away from tobacco flavors. I do agree that anyone under 18 should not be doing this, or taking any part in it. I just have watched the process of peoples lives change because of vaping. They always say how they can breath better, taste things more, and smell things better. With the people that are in this for a hobby type of deal, like myself, how is this worse than making a hobby out of tobacco pipes? With the concern to small children, of course if you drink a whole bottle it will be harmful its the same with any other chemical in your house, dish detergent, any soap, any bug killer.

I am 43 years of age, married to my high-school sweet heart & best friend for 23 years. We have 2 wonderful boys. One is 20 and contributes to society, works hard each day and provided me with my 1st Grandson, Luke. My other Son is 19 years old and has a form of Autism and resides w/ my Wife & I.
I started smoking at the very young age of 13. It was cool and hip to smoke cigarettes back in those days, so I thought.
At the young age of 37, I had a mild Stroke and was transported to Methodist hospital in Houston, Texas.( I reside 40 miles S. of Houston, Texas)
After many long days spent at Methodist Hospital, test, scans, ect.. Doctors learned that I had not only had Lung Disease. COPD & Emphysema. But that, I had the lung function of an 84 year old man. (from Lung test) Doctors also discovered that I had a Tumor in my Heart. Caused from a child hood heart condition or disease, which was just then discovered.  I was told at the very young age of 37 to quit smoking but only if I could it,  ‘Stress Free’. If I could not quit smoking stress free. Continue to smoke & live each day as if it were my last. Stress was going to be my deciding factor whether I live or die.
I was classified as Disabled.  I tried all the methods to quitting smoking. Non of which worked and do not work for many. Fast forward a bit. To my age of 42. I tried E-Cigarettes, on my own, not wanting to quit smoking because I was scared of the “Stress Factor”, but I was curious and I was amazed!
I was amazed at just how simple it was to quit smoking and quit stress free and in one day!
My story was published in the  Dec. 2013 Issue of the N.Y Times. The original Story was supposed  to be about ‘Invading Species. The Crazy Ants’ but was more focused on my story, John M. the writer,  learned of the work I do or did for our Wounded Warriors, Kids w/ Cancer, Troubled Teens, etc. Through my ‘Therapy Through The Outdoors Program’, which I started when I became disabled.
Here is a link to that story in the NY Times. The Readers Digest of the US & Canada has published it as well.  http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/magazine/crazy-ants.html?_r=0 I currently focus my time to help smokers quit smoking by means of Vaping or E-Cigarettes, through my series of comedic, humorous video’s on YouTube & through Social Media sites. I do this because it’s so simple to stop smoking, easily and stress free by using these Vaping devices. I cannot see how these devices can be regulated as either medicine or tobacco. Since said devices are neither both. E-Cigs or Vaping is just a tool to use as an easy way to quit smoking and start living a healthier life style, without harming others. As Many Studies show. 2nd hand vapor is harmless. We all want “reasonable” regulation. With that said, costly regulation would be past down to me, the Vaper, the consumer and that would make smoking real analogs much easier and cheaper than the safest, most effective tool know to help smokers quit and save lives! That would be ecigs.. I say this because remember when I stated that when I was 37 years old and in the Hospital w/ Heart and Lung disease  and the Lung function of a 84 year old man?  Well, I’m 43 now and have been Vaping for 8 months! I know have the healthy lungs of a 54 year old man. Something that was never foreseen by doctors! They stated that I would be lucky to get my lung function back down to that of a man in his mid 60’s! But you see. Vaping exercises my lungs. Each time I Vape, I exercise my lungs and the function of my lungs improve!    Yes, the damage was done from when I was a smoker and I’ll never get full lung function back, but my life has improved dramatically. I can now take long walks w/ my beautiful Wife or one of our Warriors, or push a child that has cancer in a wheelchair  through the outdoors without the need of oxygen or gasping for air with each step I take. Which means spending more time outdoors doing what I love to do, with the people I love to share it with. Doing more of what I love to do,  Helping others.
If my story cannot help you consider how E-Cigarettes should be classified and or regulated. Think really hard about what E-Cigs are, what they do for many of Vaping American’s that are or were just like myself,  and who have similar stories like mine?  “These devices save lives each day and unnecessary regulation would have a deadly effect!”

204,"As a disabled veteran that has had a brain injury I had access to any and all forms of smoking cessation available. Over the years I found that none of them had any effectiveness. I am on Amantidine, a medicine for my brain, so I was unable to take Chantix. Because of my facial paralysis I was unable to use Nicorette Gum and ”the patch” never worked for me and has caused skin irritation and head aches in the past.

NOTHING worked and i didn’t have the will power to go cold turkey or stop on my own. E-Cig and or vaping allowed me to put them down and ive never looked back. My liquid is custom made so i know what goes in it. None of the chemicals, any of the known cancer causing agents or harmful materials found in a cigarette. Just flavor and nicotine.  Even my Doctor told me to keep vaping as long as it kept me off cigarettes. Please…..Don’t take away our healthier option.

206,"I just celebrated my 1 year anniversary of not smoking cigarettes.  1 year of vaping.  What has it meant to me?  At first the biggest impact was the improvement in my breathing, which was the main point of my first testimonial.  But now, one year later, there’s so much more.  At one year, there are 5581 cigarettes I have not smoked.  That’s 558 packs of cigarettes and 28 cartons.  I have lowered my risk of heart attack by 100%.  I have lowered my risk of stroke by 20.4%.  I am 46 years old.  After 26 years of smoking, I never thought I would be able to stop, nor did I want to.  But vaping has made me realize what I was doing to myself all those years.  I vape flavors, I love strawberry and banana e liquids.  And despite how good I feel now, I can say that if it weren’t for the many choices for fruity and sweet flavors of e liquids, if all I had was tobacco flavored e liquid, I may not have stayed on track with my ecig.  And if that were the case, I would probably be dead in the next 10 years.  If any decision makers take the time to read this, please please please, do not take this choice away from me or the other millions of smokers who want to live their lives just a little longer.  Because with ecigs, they have a chance.  A very very good chance.",Update Leslie can breathe better 1 year later,http://vaping.info/news/2014/update-leslie-can-breathe-better-1-year-later
207,"I am a 52 year old male, I smoked from the time I was 18ish to the time I was 46! I was a two pack a day smoker who had no intention of ever quieting. A buddy brought back a device from CA while on a vacation and I had to check it out. It was one of the older JOE units and I fell in love with it right off the bat! I started vaping and have not looked back. My last fire cig was about  years ago and I have not wanted to go back. I have tried a drag of a fire cig off and on through the years and chocked.
I breath better, I do not stink and me and my family are much better. I agree we should have quality vapor regulation but… We do not need the government to step in and play daddy!",Me and vaping,http://vaping.info/news/2014/me-and-vaping
208,"After smoking cigarettes for 39 years I have finally successfully quit with the help of vaping. 5 weeks today smoke free. Started with a tobacco flavor at 24 mg nic, next week I went to 18 the week after that 12 then 6 I am now at 0 nicotine and enjoying other flavors instead. I thank the vaping community for their help and direction and will turn others on to this wonderful product and experience",Consumer,http://vaping.info/news/2014/consumer
209,"I started smoking when I was sixteen years old and I quit smoking in September of 2013 that was some forty years ago and I have been smoke free since, I love to vape it gives me a lot of sense of peace and joy to know that I have made a great choice to quit smoking.",my story,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-story-6
210,"I smoked for 13 years. A pack a day at minimum, 2 maximum, for 13 years.  I ordered an e-cigarette in February 2013.  The day it arrived is the last day I’ve ever had a cigarette and I will NEVER go back.  Over those 13 years I tried it all; Patches, gum, cold-turkey, Chantix, the list goes on.  Nothing worked, it wasn’t simply a need of nicotine, it was the habit as a whole.  The going outside for a minute to think, the calming down before during and after a stressful day.  The mechanics of it all. But in the end I was doing myself no good.  I don’t claim that Electronic Cigarettes are “good” for me.  Yes, they still have nicotine in them.  But they also have nearly 4000-10000 less carcinogens in them.  The liquid is made of substances that are in everyday things we use from grocery store bread, to asthma inhalers, to hospital air ventilation systems. And on the topic of nicotine, I started with “e-juice” that contained 18mg of nicotine per milliliter, known as a standard amount for pack-a-day smokers.  This kept me from getting anxious and grumpy, and the after 10 months, I lowered it to 12mg, and just recently I’ve stepped down to 6mg, after only 14 months.  Now I vape more for the flavor and relaxation than I do out of pure habit and addiction.  I like my fruity flavors, and I’m 33 years old.  I like my sweet chocolate hazelnut and vanilla flavors with my morning coffee, and my dessert flavors after dinner.  I’m not a child, I’m adult who understand that delicious sweet things are NOT only for kids, and are not designed to attract them to this to hook them forever. Now I loathe walking through a cloud of cigarette smoke, and I completely understand some of the perceptions smokers have of smelling terrible, I never believed it before, but it became apparent within WEEKS of quitting smoking how bad it really smells. I’ve successfully stopped smoking, and I will defend it if I must.   Ecigs have saved my life, but I am not alone.",Never going back,http://vaping.info/news/2014/never-going-back-2

213,"I smoked cigarettes for 45 years started at age of when it was “Cool thing to do”  and smoking cigarettes were well accepted.  Over the last 15 years i have tried all the surefire methods of stopping. My habit had increased to 2-3 pack a day for at least 25 years. All the pills, patches and gum, hypnotism you name it. I  had seek professional help when i used chantix, treatment did’t last long as soon as i stopped taking them my mental health improved.  On February 16th of this year, my son bought me an ecig starter kit. I smoked my last tobacco On March 2! Since that time i have reduced my nicotine from content from 24 mi to 12mi and I’m already vaping some 6 mi! It Is amazing My sense of taste and smell have been vastly improved. I can now Breathe so much better. I am no longer a slave to tobacco.",retired,http://vaping.info/news/2014/retired
214,"I smoked a pack a day for 30 years.  I’ve tried to quit several times over the years and never made it past a couple of weeks.  I tried cold turkey, patches and nicotine gums.  Every time, I’d break down and smoke mostly due to the hand-mouth habit of smoking. Last year, I got a free sample of an e-cigarette and found it to be somewhat satisfying.  Based on that experience, I did a little research on Reddit’s Electronic Cigarette forum and proceeded to buy my first “real” e-cigarette four months ago.  It took a while to find some flavors I really liked and now my two main vapes are peanut butter and vanilla.  I can’t stand tobacco flavored e-juices and I’ve probably got twenty bottles of other flavors just to mix things up every now and then. Since I started vaping, I haven’t had a single craving for a tobacco cigarette.  I haven’t smoked a cigarette since the day I got my first mail order of e-juices. The smell of tobacco smoke makes me ill and I can’t imagine going back.  I feel so much better.  I couldn’t walk up two flights of stairs without feeling winded.  Now, I do two miles on a treadmill every night.  My sense of smell and taste have returned and I don’t smell like an ashtray.  To date, I’ve gotten four other people to switch to e-cigarettes and they are having the same experience as I’ve had.  Vaping makes quitting tobacco enjoyable.",Never going back,http://vaping.info/news/2014/never-going-back
215,"I quit smoking exactly one month ago today using an e-cigarette. I actually bought it last summer, but never stuck to it. This time, I was able to completely drop real cigarettes and replace them with the e-cig. I’ve tired everything else from the patch to the gum to prescriptions. None of which were successful. I don’t have a problem with e-cigarettes being regulated and people under the age of 18 absolutely should not be able to purchase them. They worked for me and I tell my friends who smoke to give it a try because it just might work for them.",I Quit,http://vaping.info/news/2014/i-quit-2
216,"I’ve tried many pharmaceutical products to permanently quit smoking and none succeeded (Chantix, patches, and nicorette gum).  After one week of trying e-cigs, I am off tobacco.  Two months later, I have lowered my nicotine intake from 2.4mg to .3mg.  Noticeable difference with improved breathing and sleeping within 1 month.  I am glad that I could choose an e-cig is a permanent solution to quit smoking.    It is INSANE that there is legislation to stop e-cigs while there is no ban to stop selling cigarettes.  Once again, it must be the money trail (tobacco companies, state and federal taxation income).  If you have a mind, question any legislation that bans or attempts to control our personal rights.",Done with Smoking,http://vaping.info/news/2014/done-with-smoking
217,"I smoked two packs a day for 25 years. I wanted to try to quit and I tried pills, patches, gums, and nothing worked. Then I tried the electronic cigarette type, it frustrated me because I wasn’t getting enough vapor. Then I discovered the vaporizer!  It was wonderful! I was able to get a nice thick cloud of vapor and it was perfect! I have not touched a a no log cigarette since. I felt no withdrawls and my smell started coming back! I lost the wheeze I used to have! I felt more energy and had a all around great feeling. I owe this all to vaping! Vaping has been a God send for me! Quite possibly it has saved my life!

218,I tried every possible method of quitting smoking cigarettes for years. I did have some mild success with a few of them. The longest period of cessation was 6 months. The problem was that I never stopped romanticizing smoking. I thought about it constantly. Any time something stressful happened or an event I wanted to celebrate I always thought about buying a pack. It was always on my mind. I thought about cigarettes constantly.  I tried ecigs because I was sick and I thought it might be better for my lungs and I might start feeling better quicker. After I got over my short illness I tried to go back to cigarettes but I found that I didn’t like them. I quit smoking and started vaping full time. It’s not that I quit smoking for health reasons. I used vaping as an alternative. It turns out though that my respiratory system works better. I don’t wake up feeling like a bowling ball is resting on my chest. I don’t wake up coughing until my face is red. I don’t get winded after climbing a flight of stairs. I don’t start coughing every time I laugh hard. Me and my family don’t need a scientific study to know that it’s better for me. It’s happening to me. I’ll believe that evidence before I believe any study that was funded by people that have money to make or loose based on the results of that study.,My Testimony,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-testimony-2

225,"I’ve smoked for 29 years and decided to try one of these “ecigs” a little over 2 years ago. My main reason was purely for convenience so I could use it in my home office. My home office is loaded with lots of expensive computer equipment that I don’t smoke around because it really limits the lifespan of the hardware and going down the stairs, out the door, got to be a bit of a drag. And on days when it was cold or rainy, which aren’t that many but still we get them, it was annoying. After being a dual use smoker/vaper for a few months I met someone who had an eGo battery and I decided to “upgrade”. It worked so much better than those cig-alikes and for some reason I stopped being a dual use smoker/vaper within a week or two. At some point I went out for a regular smoke and was disgusted by the smell and taste. Wondered how on earth I ever did that for 29 years and getting to understand what my wife meant with “it stinks”. Haven’t looked back since. Upgraded some more and really got into the hobby and activism side of vaping as a result but I feel much better and everyone else notices that too. Within a few months of vaping and not smoking I managed to walk uphill for 15 minutes without a problem, something I had not been able to do in the decades prior.",My Testimony,http://vaping.info/news/2014/my-testimony

228,"I am a 53 year old grandmother from Washington State who had been smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day (depending on stress levels) for roughly 36 years.  I was resigned to never quitting, as it made me violently anti-social to exist without nicotine, but neither or my children ever smoked, or wanted to, and both were very disappointed when I tried, and failed, to quit cold turkey.  Patch gave me a skin rash.  Always hated any kind of gum, so that was out for me.
Then, in June 2013, my daughter got me a cheap gas station e-cig.  It wasn’t fully satisfying, but it was still an epiphany that it could satisfy my urge at all, so I was waffling back and forth between these cheapies and real cigarettes for roughly six months, telling myself that smoking less real cigarettes was still a health improvement.
Then, in January 2014, my son got me an Ego Twist (and also introduced me to a real vapor store in the process) and it was leagues above the cheapie cigs, but I would still smoke analogs when I got up and around 5:00 pm and anytime a smoking family member visited.  This went on  through February, so about 2 months, and I would just tell people I would never ‘quit quitting’  Remember that I never thought I would ever be able to quit – I thought I’d die gasping for breath like my grandfather did – and naturally, as I waffled, the real cigs tasted worse and worse, until I couldn’t finish them.
It was so effortless and natural, and in March I quit buying real cigs at all.  So I have been tobacco free for six weeks, and, like so many others, I am never going back.
These e-cigs are saving lives, and people with COPD, emphysema (grandpa), et cet can’t just afford to wait around and keep smoking analog cigs till they die because folks want to sit on their hands until we know the long term effects.  Why aren’t they listening to us, long-term smokers who actually KNOW what weŕe talking about?  How many more smokers will die while idiots make false equivalencies between vaping and smoking?  There is NO comparison!  Plus my daughter finally doesn’t flinch when I sit down beside her, something I had never noticed till I started vaping.

I would quit a few times, but always missed smoking until I started using Electronic Cigarettes in May 2010.  From then on, my desire for real cigarettes was cut to about 10% of what it was before that time.  I smoked 1.5 – 2pks a day and after using the Ecigs I was down to maybe one cigarette a day, that went on for months and in 2011 I stopped buying cigarettes.  I had a short lived return to smoking in 2012 and every bit of it was terrible, the taste, the smell and the physical symptoms of chronic bronchitis returned 10 fold, I was told by a physician that was at the beginning stages of COPD and or Emphysema.  I went back to full time use of the Electronic Cigarettes with maybe only one real cigarette a week.  In August 2013 I made up my mind that there was nothing whats so ever to be gained by smoking and haven’t had a puff since.

234,"43 year long, smelly, nasty death-wish love/hate affair with tobacco cigarettes is finally over! Started at 13 and loved / hated every moment. Never really tried to quit and resigned to a life-long (as shortened as it was going to be) habit. Bought my first kit (2 batteries & clearo’ tanks) for 2 reasons: 1) curiosity and, 2) expecting to save some money.  Notice I don’t say anything about hoping to quit – that was never a part of my ‘plan’ (a word I don’t like to often use!). Just curious & a tightwad. Over the course of the next week I realized I was reaching for the vapor more & more. Reason: the flavor! One day I mentioned to the guy who sings baritone in my barbershop quartet (fellow smoker) that I’d only had 1/2 a cigarette that day. His response was simple: “why bother?” That was it – I was done!!! The simple question helped me realize I was continuing with those 1/2 – 2 tobacco-burners (t-burners)  a day for no real reason. What came next was my self-identification changed… I now saw myself as an EX-smoker. Withdrawal symptoms? No cravings, no impulse to take just a quick hit, never got cranky (at least that *I* noticed)… nothing! I kept thinking I must be *cheating* somehow – it’s a universal RULE that quitting smoking has to be painful, mentally torturous, a life-altering experience burned deeply into the victim’s brain. Was it possible to quit smoking by “accident” and with no intent or effort? YES YES & YES!!! 99% safer for me, and the worst thing I can do to a bystander is make them hungry for cinnamon rolls & caramel coffee with the flavors I vape. My family & loved ones are ecstatic for my success & the prospect of me being around for a whole lot longer than had vaping / e-cigarettes been banned by the FDA & intrusive government regulation that would have kept these life-savers away from me. Oh yeah, and the quartet is a lot happier – I can hit a high F without 3 hours of warm-up! My life, my choice, and I will NEVER let the governments, American Lung Assc, American Cancer Society, or ANYONE take away my NEW LIFE!!!!",How I accidentally quit smoking after 43 years,http://vaping.info/news/2014/how-i-accidentally-quit-smoking-after-43-years
235,"In March of 2011, at the request of my daughter, I bought myself a disposable ecig. I had no intention of quitting smoking as I had tried many times and spent thousands of dollars on NRT products that did not work for me.  I had quit while pregnant 3 times but always went back for one reason or another. After using my disposable for a couple of days I thought to myself “hmm this isn’t half bad” I did more research and found a shop near me so went in and bought a little kit. Within two months I no longer WANTED  a cigarette. I will be 1000 days smoke free in a few days thanks to these products and am determined to not have them taken away from myself or the millions of others who use them.",Ecigs saved me from tobacco,http://vaping.info/news/2014/ecigs-saved-me-from-tobacco

He gave me his kit because it was too strong for him and he was too far gone by then. I smoked a pack a day for 28 years and quit overnight thanks to ecigs. Seriously, electronic cigarettes or e-cigs are my Declaration Seeking Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness… from tobacco.  I started smoking cigarettes as a young teenager and later added cigars to the mix.  Found ecigs and the rest is history.  My wife and family really appreciate the fact that I don’t stink and I just might live a little longer.

238,"I started smoking around 14. At first it was just bumming off a few cigarettes every once in a while, but I started buying my own packs when I was 15 and built it up to a 30-a-day (pack and a half daily) habit. I tried quitting on numerous occasions, with the patch twice, gum once, and even tried cold turkey. None of them worked – my longest streak being a mere 2 weeks. By the time I was 26, I had all but given up on quitting. In truth, I always enjoyed smoking – I was just a little worried about the health impact of my habit. I discovered e-cigarettes after 16 years of smoking at least 30 cigarettes a day. I have to admit, I was skeptical, but if I could enjoy the habit, the psychological aspect, and not feel like I was being neutered by not having a cigarette, I decided to give them a try. I never really wanted to quit, mind you, but after a few weeks it occurred to me that I hadn’t bought a pack of cigarettes in over two weeks. Two weeks became two months. Two months became two years. To this date, I still haven’t purchased a pack of cigarettes. I completely switched without even making an effort; without the wild mood swings that come from withdrawal from all the other chemicals in cigarettes; without feeling that something so ingrained in my personality, my mannerisms, and, for lack of a better word, my ego was being forcefully taken away – without feeling that a part of me, what was, for all intents and purposes, a part of me, was being amputated against my will.",E-cigs saved my life,http://vaping.info/news/2014/e-cigs-saved-my-life
239,"I’m Wayne, I am 41 years old, and the father of 2 young children and Vaping is something that has saved my life. It has helped me quit the traditional smoking of “analog” cigarettes.  My children have been asking me for years to stop smoking; it was something that I needed to do not just for my children, but for my health. I had the help of a really close friend who got me started for that I guess you could say I owe her my life. I used to smoke easily 2 packs a day.  I am a Paramedic and a Photographer, when I was photographing a wedding this could be an issue, plus, my close friend Ramy didn’t really like the smell of the cigarette smoke. I guess i never really knew how bad it really smelled or that no matter what cologne or spray you used to “try” and cover up the smell… it was still there. Those who don’t smoke CAN smell it and most will let you know. My kids were no exception, they would tell me all the time “Dad, you stink like cigarettes”, I took this all into consideration along with my health concerns and I began my journey down the road to not smoking cigarettes.
This was a road I had traveled several times before, and it always ended up the same way, back to smoking again… One day while I was at work on the Medic Unit and we were going to get some lunch at a new local diner, I happened to stumble upon Liberty Vapor which was right next to the diner. I chose to go in and see what it was all about. 2 months later…. I find myself at Liberty Vapor several times a week, meeting new people and learning new things about the Vaping community. As of this post I have been “Analog Free” for 3 months 20 days and 10 hours and I have not had to use any of my asthma medication and have had no issues with my asthma.

246,"My story so far,
I am a 59 year old male living in the UK, smoked since I was about 9 years old, 30+ cigarettes per day, more when out socialising, so a good 50 years on the death sticks, I didn’t really have any plans to give up smoking as I enjoyed it so much, after having suffered a heart attack (MI) 12 years ago, was forced into giving up by a stay in hospital, stayed off them for 6 months when I came out, but when out socialising missed them and had the occasional cigar, not wanting to get into a more expensive form of smoking habit went back on the cigarettes.
Until June of 2013 when I purchased a cigalooklikey from eBay, not cheap by any means but cheaper than 3-4 packs of cigs, and was very surprised to find they did the same or nearly as good a job as the cigs, but the problems were the batteries dying too quickly, so looking around at other types of ecigs found the next stage 2 type, the ego style with a tank you could fill yourself, but more importantly, longer battery time. Started to watch uTube video’s about recoiling and how to do it yourself, and saw the next stage 3 type mods with bigger tanks, gennies, drippers and the like which is where I’m at now, 6 months cigarette free, not one in that time and have no desire whatsoever to go back to smoking tobacco cigarettes. I can see even after 6 months the definite benefits now of not smoking, like wheezy chest has gone, permanently blocked nose(sinus) has gone, I can breath better, my taste is a lot better, don’t smell of tobacco smoke in myself and my clothes any more, and the most important thing is the amount of money I now don’t spend compared to tobacco, and generally feel a lot fitter than before.  Vaping,(not smoking or even looks like smoking) is my new hobby now and any body who thinks it is smoking because of the vapour produced(similarity ends here) is the same as smoking is delusional, because this is the biggest public health breakthrough the world has ever seen it got me off cigarettes for good and that can only be a good thing.

    I am 50 years old and started smoking when I was 14. Over the last ten years I have tried everything to stop… patches, gum, zyban, champix and all to no avail…… In fact the zyban and champix had very serious side effects and one doctor would not prescribe as she said they were a dangerous and ‘dirty’ drug’……
   September 2011 a friend gave me a go on his ecig….. I haven’t smoked since….. It was a first generation ecig that did the job but no where near as effectively as the ecigs I use now i.e. the 3rd generation ones. The benefits of using e cigs has been quite amazing…. I can breathe, I dont stink of tobacco and neither does the house! and my finances are much healthier!
       The ecig finally gave me the break I needed in stoping the cigarette smoking, however I was very skeptical about the contents and mode that they produced vapour, so I spent many hours researching……  It did not take long to realise that e-cig use is far safer than cigarettes with very little risk at all. What was very surprising has been the stance by ill informed politicians, big pharma and official health bodies who I always thought to be reputable health organisations such as the WHO and the UK Cancer trust who have been pushing ridiculous anti e-cig messages out to the general public….

 NOTHING helped me or worked till i got a e cig (mod).
I stopped smoking HARMFUL cigarettes the first day of vaping……..i have not smoked a cigarette in over 7 months. If you knew me and how i smoked you would find that amazing. I now can smell people who smoke, i find that funny? My tongue is sensitive and i had to lower the amount of hot sauce i use (lol)
 My mom died of cancer, she smoked for many many years……while i was growing up she tried hard to stop smoking over the years, she never could. She would shut herself up in the bedroom and only come out to get something, she was not pleasant at these times.

I tried quitting several times with no success. I grew up in a smoking household and one of my greatest wishes, was that my mom quit smoking. Together, February 1st 2011, my mom and I decided to try electronic cigarettes. Since that day, neither of us have smoked a combustible cigarette. In 23 months being smoke free, my mom and I have experienced extremely positive improvements to our health. Personally, I can breath again. My smokers cough has gone away. Sense of taste and smell have also come back. Equally important, my wife, who used to get bouts of bronchitis from my smoking, no longer gets them. Seeing these changes first hand has made me a believer. I have also become aware of the HUGE political campaign against e-cigs, and find it appalling, that the biggest harm reduction tool EVER, is getting backlash. We have greedy state, local and federal governments along with those related to the Pharmaceutical industry and its allies to thank for our ongoing challenges. We as a vaping community need to stand together and let all concerned parties know, we will not tolerate being shunned and bullied as we once were as smokers. We need to be clear it is not alright for governments to take our vaping away. There are too many smokers currently who have not experienced the joy and benefits of quitting, as I have, thanks to vaping.

The patch, gum, and even medication, although I never believed myself to be sick! None worked. Always I ended up with a pack of cigarettes in my hand.

275,"Hi, I’m Anthony from Northampton, England.
This is my story I first started smoking at the age of 15. I’m now 51 so do the maths and that’s 36 years of smoking. I can’t remember how many I used to smoke, but up until about 8 weeks ago I was on 25 – 30 rollups a day. I had tried to quit, admittedly only a few times over the years. In last couple of years I have tried a little harder. Did the cold turkey first, that lasted until lunch. Tried the patches, smoked just as much with them. Tried the gum, found that stuff nasty. Then gave up trying.
   My journey to actually becoming an ex-smoker, began on my tea break at work about three months ago. One of my work colleagues (how was a smoker) was sitting in the smoking area sucking on this thing. I’ve seen those e-cigs that look cigarettes and it was not one of those. It looked like my multi bit screw driver in my tool box. So me being nosy asked what it was. It’s my personal vaporizer, I use it instead smoking, I quit. Was the reply. What quit completely, you where smoking the other day. Yes but it took me two days, was the reply.
    How does that work then. He then roughly explained that the nicotine is in the liquid, you press the button to vaporize it, and inhale the vaper.  Give us a go then, you’ll choke on it he said, and with a huge lung full yes I did. After a minute or two when the choking had subsided, I realised I like that, and had another go. For warned is for armed, so didn’t inhale as much, so only a small cough. I do like that where do I get one.
  Skip a week waiting for the postman to deliver PV.
It’s here now lets see. Day one, this is a was of time still want a smoke. No I need more will power. No I need more will power and a plan. So I drew up my plan. Now I have set times during the day when I can smoke (tea breaks), so replace a tea break smoke with a vape only. This is working, so proceeded to swap the rest of the tea break smokes for vaping. After about a week of this I was stuck. I was down from 20+ a day to 5. Two in the morning to get going, and two or three in the evening.
 This went on for about another week, and all the while the cigarettes seemed to taste weird.  That’s because your taste buds are changing, from not smoking as much, I was told, by an ex smoker. My final step to being an ex smoker was hard. I woke up exactly one month ago from writing this lot, that I was out of tobacco. At this point I made the decision not to got to the shop for more, unless I really had to. This was the hardest bit for me. I did find that I could use different strengths of nicotine and differnet flavours just by carrying two tops for my PV.  24mg/ml for when the craving as high, and a much lower level 12mg/ml for general use so to speak. Now one month on I find I no longer need the higher level because I don’t get much of a craving any more. All of my many flavours of liquid are now 12mg/ml or less.
      At this moment in time I don’t think I’m ready to give up the nicotine entirely but I am planning to try and cut down the levels slowly. With a long term view to stop vaping as well.
    Well that’s the short version of my road to being an ex smoker I’ve just got to hope no-one messes it up for me. As I do not want to go back. There is a lot I have learnt on my journey, about all the different personal vaporizers available, and how maintain them. (sorry I’m not into those ones that look like cigarettes).

I through it away and have not had any tobacco since.  Vaping a e-cig is just a better experience.  Within months my breathing & sleeping improved.  Over next many months food began to taste good again.  I savored my food more and thus ate less.  I lost weight.  Every aspect of my health has improved as a result of switching.

Tired of being looked down upon and feeling like a third class citizen. Tired of feeling like I needed to hide to have a smoke, something that was once perfectly okay to do. Most of all tired of the smell and feeling like I was letting down my son. I had tried the gums, patches and never quit. Analogs ruled my life. I saw a commercial about vapor cigarettes and after some thinking I went to VaporKings. I purchased a pen style e-cigarette and some juice thinking to myself ‘I have a half a pack left.’ I had failed soo many times before I wasn’t going to get my hopes up.

One of my roommates who had smoked for over 30 years, had a health scare.  Thankfully, he is ok and it was just that, a scare.  He decided he was going to quit one way or the other, with or without us other two.  And announced he was buying an e-cig and going to try.  The two of us that did not want to quit smoking, even though I was again coughing up grey pudding each and every morning upon waking, did not want to start walking downstairs and going outside every time we wanted a smoke.

282,"In the fall of 2010 I purchased my first e-cig, an Njoy Pro after my Mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Small Cell Carcinoma. Her oncologist recommended it to me after based on input from some of his other patients who used it to quit smoking. And for the most part it worked to help me cut down.  On January 31st, 2011, my mother passed away due to complications from pneumonia as a result of her cancer.  I knew right then, looking at my 6 year old daughter who had just one of the people she loved most in the world, that I had to quit smoking tobacco. I spent the next few months trying everything to quit. The patch failed as it did nothing to make me not crave a cigarette. I moved to the lozenge on the recommendation of my doctor, but having the ‘candy’ in my mouth for more than a minute would trigger my gag reflex. I tried the gum but discovered that I needed to chew more than I would have spent on cigarettes in a single week to even remotely quell the smallest craving. Support groups didn’t help either. I ended up back on tobacco full force again. I avoided Chantix after watching a friend almost lose his life in a bout of depression, and my doctor agreed that he did not like writing prescriptions due for the med due to the known side effects. A friend of mine at work purchased a V2 electronic cigarette on a whim. While out on break he let me try it and it worked better than the Njoy Pro I had previously used. I order myself a kit shortly after and used that exclusively for the next month. Due to a miscalculation I ran out of carts a day before my next order was to be delivered. In a moment of desperation I bummed a cigarette off a friend after leaving a movie theater. It was possibly the worst mistake I had made. It was like high school all over again. I took a puff and began to feel dizzy, choked on the second puff and coughed till I popped blood vessels in my left eye. Dizzy, nauseous and defeated, I stubbed the cigarette, went home and went to bed. From that point forward I never felt the need or desire to touch a cigarette again. Today I enjoy living without tobacco. I understand that while vaping is not the perfect solution, it is far less harmful than burning tobacco. My health has improved – I feel a thousand times better than I have since I started smoke when I was around 17. Even my doctor comments on how much better I look and sound. I enjoy chasing my kid around and it feels awesome that I can now keep up with her and my girlfriends kids without having to sit and rest every five minutes to catch my breath. I like that I don’t get the “You’re a smoker, aren’t you. You smell like cigarettes..” comments anymore. I just feel more alive than I have in the last 15 years that I smoked tobacco.

286,"Some people make the decision for whatever reason to try vaping and love it,some replace partial cigarette use with it and some do make a switch.
For some it isn’t a real enough experience and they go back to smoking.
For now I am going to talk about myself,it is sometimes easier to explain myself than it is to explain others. As a child I could remember smoking in places like the shopping center or the local restaurants.
My mom and dad had always smoked,so did my brothers and later on I did as well.
I am not a quit type of person,never have been.
I had no desire to quit and no real financial intensive to pay prohibitively high sin taxes to my government for indulging in what is a perfectly legal behavior.
Until this time around two years ago I had never questioned why no one could smoke indoors in a public place anymore or why people didn’t like us when we smoked outdoors.
That part had bothered me most  the nasty behavior by other people when I would go outside to smoke,you know what I mean,the coughing,the handwaving the “helpful” advise “Those things will kill you.”.
I had never experienced mean beyond that though,I live in a pretty small town and most of us know each other,it does make some difference I guess. Being that I am curious and the fact that I read a lot I before I even attempted to begin to use e cigs started reading,looking for a reason why our freedoms were being trampled,why no smoking zones outdoors were being moved further and further away.
No one really had any useful information until I somehow found myself here (http://www.forces.org/).
From there it was a short journey to other places with more useful information.
Back in those days Christopher Snowdon hadn’t begun blogging and I had no idea exactly who half the people on my blog sidebar were.
But I was pretty sure of one thing this man (http://cleanairquality.blogspot.com/2006/09/true-confessions-of-my-reasons-for.html)  told a story so amazing,so sickening that I had to check and be sure what he was saying was true and it was.
There is a point that most people reach and it changes them,reading this stuff changed me.
If nothing else it made me more aware,made me take a harder look at the places I spent my money and the companies I gave my money to.
Worse than what I found there was the sad and slowly sinking feeling I started to get in the pit of my stomach that some of the money I paid out in state and federal cigarette taxes was going to persecute me and other smoker’s like me.
My parents,my brothers,friends and people I had never even met were being hurt by the money I was putting into these coffers.
I had never ever thought of growing my own tobacco or buying roll your own tobacco but I knew I had to do something.
The idea for electronic cigarettes was something I thought about for months,it wasn’t the easiest decision I ever made.
Do I use electronic cigarettes?
Yes
Do I still consider myself a smoker?
Absolutely
I didn’t do this for my health,I did this because I had high hopes that starving them (the government,the charities) would change their minds.

287,"My name is James and vaping changed my life!  On a cold afternoon on 12/23/2011 I stepped outside the back door of my home and smoked my final cigarette. As I stood there shivering in the cold, feeling the burn of the smoke as I drew it into my lungs, I wondered how difficult it would be for me to stop using them. Just a few days ago I had left the doctors office where he had told me that the bad bronchial infection I had wasn’t just a seasonal woe (I had coughed so much that my throat was raw and my head pounding) Shortness of breath, smelly clothes, halitosis. This was all the norm for me but just inside the door of my house was a box with my first e-cig and an assortment of liquids.  I dropped the remains of my cig to the ground and ground it out with my heel and then stepped inside. After a few minutes of assembling my new e-cig, I dripped some 18mg menthol tobacco on the atomizer and took a long slow drag. Hrmm, It didn’t taste exactly the same as a regular cig but there was something I liked about it. It was clean tasting, my tongue didn’t burn. I tried a few other flavors but couldnt tell apple from apricot since my tongue and nose was still full of smoke particles from that last analog….  (fast forward to 2 weeks later)
Discovered the joys of actually tasting my food. I never realized how crippling the cigarettes were to my olfactory senses and tastebuds. The wife actually allowed me to use my ecig inside the house and found some of the flavors quite pleasant. I wasn’t wheezing anymore! I’d discovered that Apple/Strawberry/Menthol was my favorite flavor and would be for some time to come…. (Current day)
That was just a brief synopsis of the early months of my journey into using a THR (Tobacco Harm Reduction) product. Since then I’ve obviously reaped the longer term benefits of being smoke free and I’ve also learned a lot about what goes into the product I’ve been using.  Obviously many of you are probably familiar with PG/VG/NIC/Flavoring but let’s talk about nicotine.  Nicotine is an alkaloid in the same family as Caffeine (Coffee, Soda, Energy Drinks) and Theobromine (Chocolate) They are all stimulants with different types of effects on the human body. I believe Nicotine has been wrongfully demonized since in it’s pure extracted form it is not carcinogenic. Obviously at the current time, the mainstream media has been littered with anti-ecig articles and stories. Over the course of the last 2 years, I’ve had the privilege of being able to help at least 30+ people that I know personally to take back their health and their lives from the addiction to cigarettes that they had once been a slave to.   With legislation looming and with our friends in the EU currently fighting for their right to vape, there’s a lot of uncertainty about what our future may look like as vapers. The best thing we can do is to get the word out there on how it has transformed our lives and the lives of those we know and love. It may be a gradual change but I’m confident that once more people have seen how it can be a catalyst for good, they will come around.",Vaping changed my life!,http://vaping.info/news/2013/vaping-changed-my-life
288,"My name is Kevin and I made the switch to vaping 4 1/2 years ago. Since I’ve decided to make the switch I haven’t smoked a single cigarette. I made the decision to make the switch because I had been smoking cigarettes for over 20 years and could feel it was starting to effect my health. I couldn’t do any sort of psychical activity for more than 10 minutes without getting tired. I would wake up every morning coughing. My sense of taste and sense of smell started to deteriorate. I knew if I continued to smoke cigarettes it would eventually put me in an early grave. The problem I had was I loved smoking and didn’t want to quit. One day when I was online I came across an ad for a blu cigs electronic cigarette. I had never heard of an electronic cigarette before and found the concept very interesting. I thought to myself this could possibly be a way for me to continue smoking without having to smoke cigarettes anymore. I instantly purchased one. Once I received the kit and started using it I instantly knew that it was going to work for me. Whenever I felt like having a cigarette I would just use the electronic cigarette and it completely satisfied my urge to smoke. In the coming months I also started to notice that all the adverse health effects I was getting from smoking cigarettes started to go away. Within 6 months I felt like I did before I started smoking cigarettes. I believe that the electronic cigarette is one of the greatest inventions since the internet or cell phone. The way I look at it is I’m a smoker. For years the only choice I had as a smoker is to use cigarettes. Now, I have another choice which is the electronic cigarette. I know the electronic cigarette doesn’t have the thousands of harmful chemicals that cigarettes have. I also know that it is a much healthier alternative to using cigarettes. How do I know that? My health and the way I feel has told me. Because of my choice to use an electronic cigarette I know I have added years to my life which I probably would have lost if I continued to smoke cigarettes.",Kevin’s Testimonial,http://vaping.info/news/2013/kevins-testimonial
